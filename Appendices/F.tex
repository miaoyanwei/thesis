Miao, Yanwei 00:00:00.739 -- 00:00:15.500 \\
Okay, I think you have received the information that it's recording right now and for your demographical information, I would like to ask about your gender.

Participant B 00:00:16.100 -- 00:00:20.580 \\
A male.

Miao, Yanwei 00:02:17.700 -- 00:02:20.860 \\
Do you mind letting me know your age?

Participant B 00:02:20.940 -- 00:02:22.700 \\
30.

Miao, Yanwei 00:02:24.420 -- 00:02:29.700 \\
And your educational background.

Miao, Yanwei 00:02:40.100 -- 00:02:43.300 \\
And like, what, what did you study, what is your subject?

Participant B 00:02:43.340 -- 00:02:51.100 \\
So I started geography, which is the main topic and it was about environmental and climate change.

Miao, Yanwei 00:02:55.460 -- 00:02:59.020 \\
And your occupation right now.

Participant B 00:03:00.060 -- 00:03:03.740 \\
So I'm working for the ISI, It's like.

Participant B 00:03:06.740 -- 00:03:09.540 \\
I don't know the English expression actually, so it's wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiter.

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:15.660 -- 00:03:23.540 \\
Okay, that's, that's fine. And May, I know whether you have a bit of knowledge or interesting, AI.

Participant B 00:03:25.100 -- 00:03:28.820 \\
The first part of the thing was, was a little bit.

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:31.420 -- 00:03:35.780 \\
Do you have any knowledge or do you have any interest in AI?

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:37.060 -- 00:03:38.340 \\
Artificial intelligence.

Participant B 00:03:39.220 -- 00:03:49.220 \\
Not really no, not more than like, the, the basic interest in I just tried out the new tools which are available, but not more than that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:49.220 -- 00:03:55.980 \\
Okay, and do you have any knowledge or interest in the energy domain?

Participant B 00:03:57.180 -- 00:03:58.780 \\
Since I.

Participant B 00:04:00.180 -- 00:04:14.820 \\
A lot of time into researching for my masters thesis I have a little bit experience in the field of district heating and, and a wind power as I worked as a wind power company before.

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:15.460 -- 00:04:16.579 \\
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:19.299 -- 00:04:38.500 \\
Sounds good, thank you. So maybe also I would like to know something about your attitudes towards energy efficient technologies. Have you heard of energy efficient appliances or renewable energy technologies for households.

Participant B 00:04:44.300 -- 00:04:56.420 \\
So you mean like installation measures or new technologies regarding eat production or on water production. Something like that, or what do you mean?

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:56.500 -- 00:05:00.900 \\
Yes, basically like, very general, have you ever heard of any.

Miao, Yanwei 00:05:03.460 -- 00:05:13.660 \\
And have you ever considered implementing energy efficient technologies such as solar panels or smart thermostats.

Participant B 00:05:15.220 -- 00:05:34.180 \\
We're talking about installing smart term as we also have an electric car, we would like to use it to better plan the charging procedure, and then we also are talking about getting our roof insulated better insulation.

Participant B 00:05:34.940 -- 00:05:41.220 \\
It's hardly insulated now, but we want to increase the installation and.

Participant B 00:05:41.980 -- 00:05:47.500 \\
Also thinking about buying a footable tank.

Participant B 00:05:49.740 -- 00:05:56.860 \\
Tags, but the lack of money right now can afforded, but it's, we have plans for it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:05:57.220 -- 00:06:06.580 \\
Sounds good, and what is your understanding regarding the benefits of energy efficient technologies.

Participant B 00:06:10.100 -- 00:06:25.940 \\
Reduction of the needs. So we, we would need less energy consumed and obviously also for, for example, the roof insulation, it's in the summertime or during the winter, it's less.

Participant B 00:06:27.340 -- 00:06:32.420 \\
Strong changes in the room temperature, which is beneficial as well.

Miao, Yanwei 00:06:33.780 -- 00:06:39.140 \\
And do you know climate change And why is it important to individuals?

Miao, Yanwei 00:06:42.660 -- 00:06:55.060 \\
Climate change and why is climate change important for individuals to save energy or utilize renewable energy resources.

Participant B 00:06:55.820 -- 00:07:15.940 \\
You mean why it is important to everybody, and why everybody should, I think everybody should do what, what he or she can do in order to reduce their demand so that in, in total, the demand decreases and the targets, which are set for.

Participant B 00:07:16.140 -- 00:07:19.780 \\
For the entire community can be reached so...

Participant B 00:07:20.660 -- 00:07:23.220 \\
Play its small part. I think.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:25.700 -- 00:07:27.700 \\
Know a lot about that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:29.380 -- 00:07:38.180 \\
Sounds good, so I, I've already finished the pre-questions and now I will send you a link.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:39.860 -- 00:07:44.100 \\
You should have received a link in our chat now.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:46.660 -- 00:07:50.500 \\
If you click the link and then you are landing our service.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:53.060 -- 00:08:05.220 \\
And do you mind to share your screen so that I can see how you operate through the website, but if you don't want to eat, you can also just say no, and just let me know which step you are.

Miao, Yanwei 00:08:59.220 -- 00:09:03.540 \\
As long as it's comfortable for you to see, then it's fine.

Participant B 00:09:04.740 -- 00:09:06.580 \\
Okay, so.

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:09.860 -- 00:09:10.500 \\
You can think out loud.

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:11.900 -- 00:09:14.340 \\
When you are navigating through it.

Participant B 00:09:14.380 -- 00:09:22.660 \\
Okay, so, so what shall I look for shall. I look for like the UI or what, what is the main topic to look at?

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:23.300 -- 00:09:25.100 \\
Everything basically.

Participant B 00:09:25.300 -- 00:09:25.860 \\
Everything.

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:26.500 -- 00:09:30.220 \\
You can just share any thoughts when you are navigating.

Participant B 00:09:30.460 -- 00:09:34.780 \\
Great, so I like the look, it's really clean. That's the first impression.

Participant B 00:09:54.020 -- 00:09:56.780 \\
So I just need to select.

Participant B 00:10:01.700 -- 00:10:07.620 \\
So I think it's pretty straightforward. You, there's not much going on on the screen. I like that.

73
Participant B 00:10:40.660 -- 00:10:42.100 \\
Okay, so.

Participant B 00:10:48.340 -- 00:10:52.580 \\
Okay, so what's, what's the screen about?

Miao, Yanwei 00:11:02.460 -- 00:11:07.420 \\
You can ask me if you think you don't understand which part.

Participant B 00:11:07.540 -- 00:11:12.620 \\
So I, I will just click here to see more details how this calculated.

Participant B 00:11:16.500 -- 00:11:17.940 \\
Maybe I just.

Participant B 00:11:36.980 -- 00:11:41.700 \\
It's this for, for, it's for.

Participant B 00:11:42.780 -- 00:11:47.780 \\
An energy build, so this is for, and electricity.

Miao, Yanwei 00:11:50.420 -- 00:11:52.980 \\
You mean the price, the total price price.

Participant B 00:11:53.020 -- 00:11:53.620 \\
Yes, yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:11:53.940 -- 00:11:59.380 \\
For all the energy, your whole house could consume.

Participant B 00:12:00.820 -- 00:12:01.940 \\
So.

Participant B 00:12:04.260 -- 00:12:06.660 \\
And electricity might take.

Participant B 00:12:30.900 -- 00:12:32.020 \\
Yes, makes sense.

Participant B 00:12:39.060 -- 00:12:41.060 \\
So it's for.

Participant B 00:12:42.900 -- 00:12:54.020 \\
For electricity and, and leading. So I just just quickly checked, but it's, it's underestimating already price.

Participant B 00:12:58.060 -- 00:13:09.140 \\
Yeah, but I think it's because we have electric car and it doesn't ask if we have an electric car in charge at home. So our electricity Bill is alone is really high. so.

Participant B 00:13:10.420 -- 00:13:14.220 \\
Do not have then fuel costs other than the electricity.

Participant B 00:13:16.180 -- 00:13:26.500 \\
So maybe it could ask for a car if, if someone has a car, then should have a higher demand for electricity.

Participant B 00:13:52.020 -- 00:14:00.140 \\
Already it was not not that much for this. I only have the numbers for last year, so.

Participant B 00:14:06.740 -- 00:14:09.300 \\
It was like, they had electricity Bill of.

Participant B 00:14:14.580 -- 00:14:19.500 \\
Three thousand, six hundred, but that's only electricity.

Participant B 00:14:21.500 -- 00:14:22.820 \\
Also, gas.

Participant B 00:14:25.340 -- 00:14:31.300 \\
Whether he was one thousand eight hundred, so.

Participant B 00:14:55.380 -- 00:15:00.060 \\
Okay, and then on the right side, you see, I can see some suggestions.

Participant B 00:15:03.940 -- 00:15:05.940 \\
Let me check. Let's see.

Participant B 00:15:10.100 -- 00:15:20.980 \\
Annualized cost, okay, and does it also show, like total costs or it like the total investment costs.

Participant B 00:15:33.900 -- 00:15:35.700 \\
Yeah, that's good.

Participant B 00:16:33.940 -- 00:16:39.660 \\
IZED investment costs of two thousand something. Yes, so I would.

Participant B 00:16:41.660 -- 00:16:44.820 \\
In total, I would pay like a hundred more.

Participant B 00:16:45.860 -- 00:16:46.100 \\
Okay.

Participant B 00:17:13.740 -- 00:17:24.500 \\
Or will there be the, or is there going to be the opportunity to enter my own figures, like, if I- if I see, okay, this doesn't fit perfectly...

Participant B 00:17:25.339 -- 00:17:30.260 \\
Can I then alter the estimations to my demand, for example.

Miao, Yanwei 00:17:30.900 -- 00:17:38.580 \\
And you can click the more detail on the recommendation cards if you want to like, see one of these.

Participant B 00:17:38.580 -- 00:17:39.220 \\
Oh, okay.

Participant B 00:17:50.740 -- 00:17:53.540 \\
And you also program this website.

Participant B 00:17:57.780 -- 00:18:00.980 \\
It's really nice. I like, it's really clean.

Miao, Yanwei 00:18:03.580 -- 00:18:06.100 \\
Very happy, it's my first.

Participant B 00:18:06.260 -- 00:18:08.980 \\
No, I can. Yeah, I can.

Participant B 00:18:09.940 -- 00:18:12.500 \\
For example, take this away and then.

Participant B 00:18:13.820 -- 00:18:14.940 \\
Okay.

Participant B 00:18:48.340 -- 00:18:50.300 \\
Okay, that's cool.

Participant B 00:19:10.100 -- 00:19:15.860 \\
Yeah, I, I think this, this website looks as I said, it looks really good.

Participant B 00:19:19.700 -- 00:19:26.740 \\
That you can alter some things and, and see what it makes, what kind of differences it makes.

Participant B 00:19:34.420 -- 00:19:42.220 \\
That's really cool. And so what is, what is your plan going forward with this?

Miao, Yanwei 00:19:42.740 -- 00:19:52.980 \\
This is already actually.

Miao, Yanwei 00:19:53.860 -- 00:19:55.100 \\
The results.

Miao, Yanwei 00:19:58.100 -- 00:20:01.940 \\
Yeah, you've already reached the last phase.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:03.860 -- 00:20:20.500 \\
Thank you, and there's actually one more page, but it, you, you didn't notice it, but it's fine. It's for like, yes, it's the green bar. It says why should we turn to renewable energy?

Participant B 00:20:21.640 -- 00:20:24.440 \\
Before it was on the first page as well.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:24.680 -- 00:20:27.880 \\
Yes, but it.

Participant B 00:20:28.760 -- 00:20:32.360 \\
That's like a, like a FAQ for.

Participant B 00:20:33.640 -- 00:20:35.080 \\
Why it's important.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:35.560 -- 00:20:50.200 \\
Yes, it's for people who may want to the energy technologies, but they, they might mainly focus on the financial aspect.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:51.120 -- 00:21:00.520 \\
Provide a little bit more information regarding like climate change, so it's just, someone doesn't.

Participant B 00:21:03.720 -- 00:21:05.200 \\
That it's also.

Participant B 00:21:06.400 -- 00:21:13.800 \\
Issue of like the human society in its core and not only about the numbers.

Miao, Yanwei 00:21:17.160 -- 00:21:25.520 \\
But according to my research financial reason, it's still the main reasons for.

Miao, Yanwei 00:21:27.520 -- 00:21:29.800 \\
To choose their energy technologies.

Participant B 00:21:33.200 -- 00:21:44.040 \\
Especially in times where other energies are really expensive, it's, it would, or it could be a huge benefit to produce your own energy as well, and, and do.

Participant B 00:21:46.080 -- 00:22:04.640 \\
Something good with it as well. So I think it will always be, or it should be, maybe should be different than everybody should be doing it because it's better for the environment, but I think the, the main driver will still be the economics at the end.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:09.720 -- 00:22:14.120 \\
You have seen everything from the website, then.

Participant B 00:22:16.200 -- 00:22:17.320 \\
Fully.

Participant B 00:22:18.640 -- 00:22:25.000 \\
Haven't come fully into it now, but I can, I can do it via the link again and play around with.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:28.200 -- 00:22:39.080 \\
And now the port is eighty eighty, but maybe later we will remove the eighty eight port. We will make it global so that you don't need to type the eighty eighty in the end.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:40.400 -- 00:22:42.280 \\
Flex model dot org.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:44.200 -- 00:22:46.680 \\
And, but before.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:48.760 -- 00:23:08.400 \\
There are still some more questions after you operate with the system. Okay, I would still like to ask some questions regarding your attitude. So firstly, like, how do you feel about the recommended recommendations provided.

Participant B 00:23:09.800 -- 00:23:16.840 \\
So, as I already said in the beginning, we already thought about applying some of those recommend.

Participant B 00:23:20.320 -- 00:23:27.080 \\
In a sense, like at the moment, they're just too expensive to, to afford to implement, but.

Participant B 00:23:29.120 -- 00:23:47.040 \\
Fact that you get to play around with them and maybe you can, you can then check which size and you should go for or you get an idea at least, and then you can take that idea and go and look for solutions like technical solutions, for example, for Bettery size and the, the perfect.

Participant B 00:23:48.840 -- 00:24:06.120 \\
Recommendation for someone who can really put it in your home and then get get some offers about that thing, and then you have a number in mind, what, what we expect, I think that's a really good overview, if you are just starting, it's like the first step is go there.

Participant B 00:24:08.080 -- 00:24:13.800 \\
What can I do and how much will it be? Roughly, that's really good like that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:24:14.520 -- 00:24:30.440 \\
And, and you said you were worrying because you were worrying about the financial aspect, but after you seeing some of the recommendations where it says actually you will pay less every year.

Miao, Yanwei 00:24:31.120 -- 00:24:32.360 \\
Comparing to the.

Participant B 00:24:32.480 -- 00:24:38.760 \\
Well, the electric car you pay, you have to pay a little upfront and then you save.

Participant B 00:24:40.080 -- 00:24:53.000 \\
I think still the, the thing is to invest the money in the first place, you, you need to have some money to do the to do, So, so I think that's still.

Participant B 00:24:54.160 -- 00:25:00.520 \\
A little prevents many people from doing it. I think so, maybe they're.

Participant B 00:25:01.360 -- 00:25:04.880 \\
Be more easier accessible.

Participant B 00:25:07.560 -- 00:25:09.480 \\
How to say bottom.

Miao, Yanwei 00:25:09.480 -- 00:25:10.120 \\
Well, the big.

Participant B 00:25:10.400 -- 00:25:12.040 \\
Support from the government for.

Participant B 00:25:13.320 -- 00:25:13.960 \\
Yeah, yeah.

Participant B 00:25:13.960 -- 00:25:21.000 \\
So that, that people can do it more easily or even can pay for it on a monthly basis or something like...

Participant B 00:25:21.640 -- 00:25:27.840 \\
And that way it would be easier for, for many people to do it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:25:28.680 -- 00:25:37.000 \\
Yes, you are right? And do you find the recommendations useful or valuable?

Participant B 00:25:39.120 -- 00:25:49.160 \\
And I also, yeah, as I said, I like how it's presented it also. I think it plays a huge role, how you get the information back if it's like.

Participant B 00:25:50.640 -- 00:26:04.160 \\
If it's not like providing a good overview and it's like, you have to search for the results, then it will be, it will not be used. So I really like it that it's really clean and lightweight so to say.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:04.520 -- 00:26:07.640 \\
Thank you, so.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:09.760 -- 00:26:17.320 \\
What factors influence your decision to adopt or reject the recommendations. I think you just answered that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:19.240 -- 00:26:23.720 \\
And, you know, why the recommendations were recommended to you.

Participant B 00:26:25.080 -- 00:26:41.640 \\
Yeah, it depends on the, on the situation of the home. What would be interesting for me, for example, be like, but that's, I think that's too too deep for for a website, which ones just to make some recommendations to.

Participant B 00:26:42.360 -- 00:26:59.560 \\
Give you information to start with. Would then be like you need to know. Okay, is my building really, is it an option would be able to put a system on it because of the shape of the roof and stuff like that, but.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:06.000 -- 00:27:07.880 \\
More detailed information about.

Participant B 00:27:08.280 -- 00:27:24.520 \\
But I don't know how to apply to that website because then you would need to do them calculations on how your roof is suitable for a, for a photo TIG system and how much energy you could expect from it. For example.

Participant B 00:27:25.800 -- 00:27:32.960 \\
How large is the roof and what's the insulation and stuff? I think that's maybe out of scope.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:33.480 -- 00:27:47.560 \\
No, actually the model it provides everything, but during our first version we didn't put so much numbers in it so much data that you cannot change or you can adjust.

Participant B 00:27:48.240 -- 00:27:48.840 \\
Yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:48.840 -- 00:27:50.760 \\
But that's possible.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:51.560 -- 00:27:53.960 \\
Could be future work. Yes.

Participant B 00:27:53.960 -- 00:27:55.080 \\
So.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:55.920 -- 00:27:56.520 \\
Consider.

Participant B 00:27:56.560 -- 00:28:08.160 \\
It's really interesting, like, if it develops into a one stop opportunity to do all your calculations there. I really think that's a great thing.

Participant B 00:28:09.560 -- 00:28:16.360 \\
I work with a software for district heat planning and they also tried.

Participant B 00:28:19.600 -- 00:28:26.680 \\
Also really accelerates how people approach that. So I think that's a good thing to develop stuff like that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:28:27.880 -- 00:28:34.360 \\
I also believe so, and so you, do you trust the recommendations.

Participant B 00:28:35.880 -- 00:28:56.040 \\
Since for, for example, the first thing I rec, I noticed is that the only based on your, some of your questions and then the estimations were quite accurate now leaving behind that didn't ask for the car and that's why the recommendations don't fit perfectly, but I think.

Participant B 00:28:56.160 -- 00:29:12.680 \\
They are quite good other than that, so that makes very good impression. must be a good model behind it. So I think it's, it's good. I couldn't click on the details page on that for that, but I would like to see.

Participant B 00:29:14.720 -- 00:29:26.200 \\
Behind it, so not not for an end user, I think not the real detailed calculations, but like, split into the numbers, but probably you have that as well. So.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:26.760 -- 00:29:34.440 \\
You, you could also when you click the recommendation detail, you could also see the current data on the left side.

Participant B 00:29:34.720 -- 00:29:37.000 \\
Oh, okay, that was the current. yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:37.000 -- 00:29:37.640 \\
Yes, yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:41.480 -- 00:29:46.600 \\
Yeah, there, there's sort of like a comparison with your current situation. Yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:47.400 -- 00:29:58.800 \\
It was my fault that I've, I've only put all the links on the right side. I forgot it. I mean, thank you for, for noticing that, and I, I need to adapt my usability.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:02.840 -- 00:30:08.680 \\
I was considered also to be shown there of the current detail as well.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:12.200 -- 00:30:14.240 \\
Yes, and.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:15.520 -- 00:30:20.680 \\
What factors contribute to your trust or a lack of trust in the recommendations.

Participant B 00:30:24.060 -- 00:30:30.460 \\
So, yeah, as I said, in the first place, the numbers so that the estimations work, right? Quite correct. I think.

Participant B 00:30:32.460 -- 00:30:42.620 \\
That's the, the main reason why you can trusted if you, so, I mean, if you put in your personal data and then the calculation is quite accurate, then.

Participant B 00:30:43.540 -- 00:30:52.860 \\
Then you can rely on it in a sense that it will give you a recommendation that is not completely out of scope, like, then.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:52.900 -- 00:30:53.500 \\
Then you can.

Participant B 00:30:53.780 -- 00:31:13.980 \\
A little more and as well, what contribute, what contributes I think is the, the periods of the website is really well programmed and it works quickly smoothly. So I think that's also a part that plays an important role if you are a consumer that looks at the page and if it's.

Participant B 00:31:14.060 -- 00:31:31.900 \\
Responsive if it's not like too many options, but you can go through it very quickly. So then you will do it more likely than going through a website which takes you like two hours to complete and you will, you will never do that. So, but.

Participant B 00:31:32.700 -- 00:31:42.780 \\
Fast and responsive and looks looks good and is experiment explanations that are understandable for everyone. I think that's.

Participant B 00:31:43.420 -- 00:31:46.700 \\
A good contribution as well to trust it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:31:47.380 -- 00:31:51.020 \\
Thank you is understandable all those information provided.

Participant B 00:31:52.380 -- 00:32:12.220 \\
Yeah, at least for me, it was, but I, I'm also a little bit into the topic so I think for, for someone who owns the house and thought about it a while and has some, some of the vocabulary down, I think then it's no issue. I don't know how it.

Participant B 00:32:12.860 -- 00:32:17.340 \\
For someone who has never been in touch with a topic. I don't know, but.

Participant B 00:32:18.260 -- 00:32:22.020 \\
Doesn't seem too over complicated to me.

Miao, Yanwei 00:32:23.100 -- 00:32:30.140 \\
Great and, and did the system provide enough information for you to understand the technologies. You think.

Participant B 00:32:30.780 -- 00:32:50.620 \\
There's more descriptive text. I, I really like that as well there. I think it's better to have a small or short descriptive text that mentions the main things and not too much detail because then it also could make people not read it at all. if it's too long.

Participant B 00:32:50.620 -- 00:32:51.900 \\
So I think.

Participant B 00:32:53.180 -- 00:33:02.140 \\
It's a good balance between a short text information and keeping people on track and to do it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:33:03.540 -- 00:33:07.140 \\
Do you mean having some short.

Miao, Yanwei 00:33:08.620 -- 00:33:12.700 \\
Generalized information as well for the current technologies.

Participant B 00:33:15.660 -- 00:33:18.460 \\
Sorry, I didn't get the first part.

Participant B 00:33:41.220 -- 00:33:53.980 \\
My case is not because I already looked into it, but yeah, as I said, for someone who didn't have any contact with the topic before it might be the case, I don't know.

Miao, Yanwei 00:33:57.180 -- 00:34:14.460 \\
And maybe do you have anything you would like to share this is the last question, like, besides what I have asked you any extra thoughts about the system or anything can be IMPRO.

Participant B 00:34:17.659 -- 00:34:26.620 \\
Yeah, as I said, only the thing that you might want to enter your own figures like your own.

Participant B 00:34:27.540 -- 00:34:40.700 \\
Or the, the last, if you have a utilities, Bill and, you know, your demand you could enter it so that would make the calculations even better. I assume. so I think that would be an option for someone who.

Participant B 00:34:41.460 -- 00:34:45.940 \\
Wants to deprint it, and maybe you can also.

Participant B 00:34:47.740 -- 00:35:07.580 \\
Some values for, for offers you got from, from a company, for example, who wants to, to build your photobal tax system or something like that. Maybe you can put it into that into your system as well. Maybe that is also a good thing, but I think that's more for the advanced US.

Participant B 00:35:07.780 -- 00:35:10.780 \\
Some sort of thing like you really want.

Participant B 00:35:14.220 -- 00:35:18.980 \\
Assimulation to the, to the most accurate point, maybe.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:21.020 -- 00:35:24.860 \\
Maybe I'm trying to find out.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:27.420 -- 00:35:38.260 \\
Thank you so much. These are all the info, all the questions and I, I think we are actually, I'm, I'm three minutes exceeding my.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:39.620 -- 00:35:44.340 \\
But no, I'm sorry that I, I spent.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:48.740 -- 00:35:55.740 \\
It's really very informative information that I get from you and I, I would really like to show my appreciations.

Participant B 00:35:56.260 -- 00:35:56.860 \\
Thank you very.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:57.180 -- 00:35:58.140 \\
Thank you.

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:05.080 -- 00:15:11.280 \\
Before we begin, I would like to know some of your demographical information.

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:12.040 -- 00:15:24.080 \\
Don't mind, but if you mind, you could also just like, say that you don't want to provide such information. All right, so what is your gender?

Participant C 00:15:24.240 -- 00:15:25.360 \\
Female.

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:25.680 -- 00:15:27.400 \\
And your age.

Participant C 00:15:27.400 -- 00:15:29.120 \\
Twenty-eight.

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:29.320 -- 00:15:33.080 \\
And what is your major and your education?

Participant C 00:15:33.800 -- 00:15:35.600 \\
Major is.

Participant C 00:15:37.040 -- 00:15:43.400 \\
Human computer interactions in my masters, but industrial design is my bachelor.

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:43.400 -- 00:15:51.720 \\
Okay, the same with me and your occupation right now it's a master student, right?

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:53.000 -- 00:16:00.000 \\
And do you have any knowledge or do you have any interest in artificial intelligence?

Participant C 00:16:00.040 -- 00:16:02.680 \\
Not really not much.

Miao, Yanwei 00:16:03.880 -- 00:16:08.480 \\
And do you have knowledge or interest in energy domain?

Participant C 00:16:10.320 -- 00:16:16.920 \\
No, I would rate myself very low because I don't really know that much based on my background.

Miao, Yanwei 00:16:19.400 -- 00:16:28.840 \\
And I would like to know, have you heard of any energy efficient appliances or renewable energy technologies for households?

Participant C 00:16:30.200 -- 00:16:49.320 \\
As far as I know from my landlord and as Linda, where I left, they have artificial intelligent appliance on my, on our heater systems. So when the detector or the sensor. So called sensors, they sense that the degrees of seventeen degrees is more than in a row.

Participant C 00:16:49.480 -- 00:16:55.080 \\
For five days, they will switch completely off the heater for month.

Miao, Yanwei 00:16:55.280 -- 00:16:56.360 \\
Seventeen degrees.

Participant C 00:16:56.360 -- 00:16:57.640 \\
Yeah, for seventeen degrees.

Participant C 00:16:58.960 -- 00:17:18.520 \\
And I don't have seventeen or, or nine nineteen, but it's not over twenty. So when it's seventeen in a row and then they switch off the heating systems and then they will switch it on again in September. So this heating systems is totally controlled by the.

Participant C 00:17:19.400 -- 00:17:21.959 \\
Is not someone who set it off and.

Participant C 00:17:23.959 -- 00:17:27.959 \\
This year and Spring, we have the heating.

Miao, Yanwei 00:17:29.680 -- 00:17:30.280 \\
Which means.

Participant C 00:17:30.520 -- 00:17:36.680 \\
We don't have it even though the weather become like, eight degrees at night, the other day.

Participant C 00:17:37.400 -- 00:17:47.560 \\
We have the seventeen degrees in a row for a week and then the AI think. Oh, now it's very warm, but it's kind of a false detections. I would say.

Miao, Yanwei 00:17:52.040 -- 00:18:03.560 \\
Okay, and have you ever considered implementing energy efficient technologies such as solar panels and smarts and your home?

Participant C 00:18:03.560 -- 00:18:14.440 \\
Yes, I've heard one and, and Bosch, so it's very common that I think my colleagues they all buy this stuff, You can put it on your heat heater, turning stuff, you know, you can.

Participant C 00:18:15.200 -- 00:18:24.680 \\
And then you don't have to turn it. You just say I want the room always add twenty-one. Yeah, Celsius.

Participant C 00:18:25.480 -- 00:18:28.400 \\
They would help you to make it stable.

Miao, Yanwei 00:18:32.480 -- 00:18:34.920 \\
You also want to like, buy that thing.

Miao, Yanwei 00:18:35.080 -- 00:18:36.200 \\
For your home, if you.

Miao, Yanwei 00:18:38.160 -- 00:18:43.600 \\
And what is your understanding regarding the benefits of energy efficient technologies.

Participant C 00:18:47.080 -- 00:19:03.280 \\
I think it is in the compensation of human comfort and energy saving because if we always talk about saving savings, then we just don't use it, but I think Energy Savings should always in the balance of.

Participant C 00:19:05.720 -- 00:19:08.840 \\
Human comforts, like, you know what I mean? Yeah.

Participant C 00:19:11.400 -- 00:19:14.600 \\
But do you want me to say a definition of it? Or what, what's?

Participant C 00:19:15.320 -- 00:19:17.160 \\
Do you want me to answer from your question?

Miao, Yanwei 00:19:19.720 -- 00:19:26.720 \\
Overall, your understanding regarding the benefits of like, using such technologies.

Participant C 00:19:27.440 -- 00:19:30.600 \\
Then I would say it's more like...

Participant C 00:19:32.520 -- 00:19:33.720 \\
You, you.

Participant C 00:19:33.960 -- 00:19:42.760 \\
It's independent, it's not so not independent. It's dependent on the location. The weather condition, the wind.

Participant C 00:19:42.760 -- 00:19:51.720 \\
Or the Suns where the sun hits like the, the angle I mean, so it depends on this, and then you can make use of the.

Participant C 00:19:52.400 -- 00:20:12.840 \\
Nature resources in order to gain the last energy cost from your location, I would define like this, and I think it's very clever because I've heard that in Taiwan my country, a lot of people are promoting us to use the, the wave, the, the way.

Participant C 00:20:16.980 -- 00:20:19.540 \\
The water goes high and low. What's that called?

Participant C 00:20:22.740 -- 00:20:23.860 \\
Tide.

Participant C 00:20:24.860 -- 00:20:26.580 \\
Will go one, one month, like.

Participant C 00:20:28.100 -- 00:20:31.060 \\
And then the tide will go up to low, right?

Participant C 00:20:32.340 -- 00:20:35.460 \\
We make this into energy.

Participant C 00:20:37.460 -- 00:20:57.300 \\
Very efficient and it's also very clean, so we don't have to burn the call and I think every country or location have to think about what is the best way for them to produce energy, which is clean and efficient at the same time. So that's why I think it's good that.

Participant C 00:20:58.620 -- 00:20:59.860 \\
This, this stuff, so.

Participant C 00:21:00.500 -- 00:21:05.620 \\
Every single apartment or every single location has its.

Participant C 00:21:06.460 -- 00:21:08.820 \\
Encies like it's different.

Miao, Yanwei 00:21:13.300 -- 00:21:15.500 \\
So you, you think.

Miao, Yanwei 00:21:16.540 -- 00:21:20.820 \\
Those energy efficient technologies, they, they help.

Miao, Yanwei 00:21:22.260 -- 00:21:25.820 \\
They help like reduce energy use.

Participant C 00:21:26.740 -- 00:21:47.220 \\
No, I would say produced energy in a way that time the environment less. I wouldn't say that use less because if we want to reach a comfortable temperature or comfortable feeling, we need to use anyway at March of energy, right?

Participant C 00:21:48.740 -- 00:22:08.980 \\
Energy efficiency doesn't mean that we said, okay, now we don't switch on the heater anymore. It's that, we still have the comforts in winter times, but how do we make the energy in the most efficient way, how do we use it in the most efficient way or how do we produce it in a more, in most efficient way? So it's more like.

Participant C 00:22:10.900 -- 00:22:19.860 \\
Not compensate for our comforts, but we think about better solutions to reaching the goal of human comfort. I would say.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:20.860 -- 00:22:24.980 \\
For environmental protection, like the ultimate goal.

Participant C 00:22:25.620 -- 00:22:35.220 \\
Yeah, that's part of the goal, but in my perspective, the main goal is still we have, we, we don't compensate for our living quality.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:35.900 -- 00:22:36.500 \\
Yes.

Participant C 00:22:36.500 -- 00:22:39.060 \\
But we care about the environment of course.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:40.980 -- 00:22:57.460 \\
Make sense, okay, the last one before we start to use the service do you know, climate change and why is it important for individuals to save energy and utilize renewable energy sources?

Participant C 00:22:57.620 -- 00:23:04.020 \\
I heard about this topic of climate change when I was like, nine years old.

Participant C 00:23:05.460 -- 00:23:22.580 \\
A topic, I think a lot of movies and papers and people are talking about this that humans we imagine, we emissions a lot of co two on the globe, which is very bad and the global and the global become very warm.

Participant C 00:23:24.100 -- 00:23:26.420 \\
In the polar areas, the ice would meld.

Participant C 00:23:27.540 -- 00:23:38.580 \\
The land being less and less because the water would go higher and since we live on the island, it's possible that we would no longer be there anymore. So.

Participant C 00:23:39.380 -- 00:23:46.260 \\
When I was around nine or ten, I start to have this sense of global climate change stuff.

Participant C 00:23:47.540 -- 00:23:51.380 \\
Then may I know your question again.

Miao, Yanwei 00:23:53.500 -- 00:23:58.420 \\
It's do you know, climate change and why is it important for individuals?

Participant C 00:23:58.540 -- 00:24:00.340 \\
And I think I answered that two questions.

Miao, Yanwei 00:24:00.700 -- 00:24:06.500 \\
Yes, you did. Okay, so now I will send you a link.

Miao, Yanwei 00:24:09.940 -- 00:24:13.740 \\
And I will send it by chat.

Miao, Yanwei 00:24:16.340 -- 00:24:34.380 \\
Please open it with your browser and try to find those recommendations for your house. You can refer to the house that you, you currently are living in.

Participant C 00:24:35.540 -- 00:24:37.460 \\

This is a homepage of your home energy could be cheaper and greener. We help you decide what to invest in your home. Okay, so now I, I guess this is something that I can check of how energy efficient my house is...

Participant C 00:25:09.500 -- 00:25:29.940 \\
And then maybe I click on this to check if there's something. No, so I click on answer some questions in a few minutes, help us understand your current. Okay, this is like a survey to understand what might own houses and this is received personalized improvement.

Participant C 00:25:29.980 -- 00:25:34.060 \\
So this kind of some suggestions from the professional.

Participant C 00:25:35.060 -- 00:25:38.780 \\
Starting you agree to share you. Okay, yeah, start.

Participant C 00:25:42.740 -- 00:25:43.860 \\
Country.

Participant C 00:26:00.300 -- 00:26:01.900 \\
Right in German.

Participant C 00:26:07.700 -- 00:26:22.900 \\
Yes, when was the house built know the year of the house? Build can provide insight into its constructions. material such as compositions of the walls. Okay, I, as far as I know, our houses before.

Participant C 00:26:25.780 -- 00:26:32.140 \\
Has the house been renovated? Yes, renovation can include up, yes, exactly.

Participant C 00:26:34.580 -- 00:26:35.700 \\
Yes.

Participant C 00:26:37.140 -- 00:26:43.540 \\
How many people live in a house, So it's including my neighbors upstairs or only me, and my roommate?

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:44.220 -- 00:26:46.660 \\
It's everyone in the house.

Participant C 00:26:58.260 -- 00:27:02.020 \\
What type of heating system is used in a house?

Participant C 00:27:04.660 -- 00:27:13.620 \\
Biomass boiler district heating heat pump all the boiler. This one gas boiler.

Participant C 00:27:14.900 -- 00:27:28.340 \\
It's still a hot water tank in the house, a hot water tank or a space heating tank is a device that is used to store hot water for the domestic user to particular my boyfriend also used this one.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:28.380 -- 00:27:28.980 \\
Oh, okay.

Participant C 00:27:29.020 -- 00:27:29.620 \\
Yeah.

Participant C 00:27:31.540 -- 00:27:42.500 \\
It's a different one. Next, is there a PV system in a house, a PV system is a system that uses solar panels to convert online. No.

Participant C 00:27:44.340 -- 00:27:49.380 \\
Next a battery system, so energy is produced by Solavanos.

Participant C 00:27:50.100 -- 00:28:00.980 \\
Other sources to be used later when needed, we have a battery system for the House of heating up the water to the shower that is also c- included.

Miao, Yanwei 00:28:01.740 -- 00:28:04.180 \\
Yes, you can consider that.

Participant C 00:28:04.820 -- 00:28:12.620 \\
What is the capacity of this? I'm not so sure, but I guess it's the high, it's around this.

Participant C 00:28:15.700 -- 00:28:23.300 \\
Let me choose this one and see what would happen. Is there a smart energy management systems and a house?

Participant C 00:28:24.020 -- 00:28:25.940 \\
Otherwise consumption.

Participant C 00:28:27.220 -- 00:28:34.260 \\
I think definitely, yes, but it does not belong to me. It will also landlord because I think they definitely have one in the basement.

Participant C 00:28:35.220 -- 00:28:52.180 \\
Yes, okay, recommend. Oh, it's on the recommendation coming out your curr currently energy bills estimate to be wow three's for almost four thousand a year. So let me calculate four thousand.

Participant C 00:28:53.180 -- 00:28:59.220 \\
By twelve, which let me see. Let me calculate. that's a real.

Participant C 00:29:00.540 -- 00:29:05.620 \\
That is my payment so that I know how real this.

Participant C 00:29:10.180 -- 00:29:17.140 \\
Invited by twelve months and also depends on the summer and winter because wintertime always consume more energy.

Participant C 00:29:18.540 -- 00:29:22.900 \\
So each month re- okay, it's very, it's, it's very true.

Participant C 00:29:25.500 -- 00:29:45.300 \\
Systems battery system. Very good. It has a thing that shows me what I click on like an overview to check if I did something wrong, so I can change it five people household Germany. Okay, so if I lowest and investment in the flowing configurations are applied.

Participant C 00:29:45.460 -- 00:30:05.780 \\
The annual energy Bill is estimated B- two thousand. Let me see if there's more detail current. Yeah, it's cool that you also talk about the, month differences because of energy consumption during summer. It's any way lower.

Participant C 00:30:06.420 -- 00:30:12.180 \\
And that's why it went at times. I always like to Defin a house which have to post on me to.

Participant C 00:30:12.820 -- 00:30:26.260 \\
So you just only have to pay a certain range, but this heating cooling, ah, it also include cooling, but I don't have a cooling system. Why is it included?

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:28.740 -- 00:30:38.900 \\
To be honest, I'm not so sure, but this is how the model has calculated, but I noted it down, your confusion I will ask the expert.

Participant C 00:30:39.620 -- 00:30:48.580 \\
That's cool. Okay, so the hot water. Okay, so I think one thing it's very special for me, is that the hot water.

Participant C 00:30:49.860 -- 00:30:53.980 \\
Why is the hot water doesn't have any hot water.

Participant C 00:30:55.660 -- 00:30:57.220 \\
Winter times.

Participant C 00:31:06.500 -- 00:31:14.700 \\
And so weird home because in winter times you, you always shower hot, but in summer times you show a cold, sometimes I mean, sometimes.

Participant C 00:31:30.820 -- 00:31:35.300 \\
But I think in our house, the heating systems are heating systems.

Participant C 00:31:36.060 -- 00:31:44.260 \\
Water boilers with a water boiler. It's different energies and resources, and because the water border uses electricity.

Participant C 00:31:46.380 -- 00:31:48.100 \\
Systems use gas. So.

Participant C 00:31:48.740 -- 00:31:50.020 \\
Two different.

Participant C 00:31:51.940 -- 00:31:57.700 \\
But anyway, anyway, I, I just got confused by this graphic because.

Participant C 00:31:58.980 -- 00:32:18.820 \\
Of course, according to the system, doesn't exist in Germany or at least in my house and also the hot water should be more in December and January, February, March, April, May. Summertimes should be almost equal because we, as a female, we still shower, but not that warm.

Participant C 00:32:19.460 -- 00:32:20.740 \\
Still use it...

Participant C 00:32:21.380 -- 00:32:36.740 \\
According to this one, it's appliances. Okay, I think appliances, for example, like fridge is something that always takes up a lot of energy in our house.

Participant C 00:32:37.380 -- 00:32:57.860 \\
Open it through the year, but I, I learned from my dream roommate is that then Summertimes, we always switch the fridged into a cooler temperature. So we use less energy. I think that also makes a change because as far as I know the fridge is one of the best.

Participant C 00:32:59.420 -- 00:33:01.060 \\
A lot of energy resources.

Participant C 00:33:02.060 -- 00:33:22.180 \\
So I agree with this graphic and I want to see what it recommends me to do. Okay, this is just our estimation of my energy resources. I guess. So what can I do? This is my current one. I want to see what's gre PV means again, I think you, you have.

Participant C 00:33:22.300 -- 00:33:23.460 \\
Explain me in.

Miao, Yanwei 00:33:24.420 -- 00:33:27.940 \\
Yes, it's solar panels.

Participant C 00:33:29.020 -- 00:33:30.500 \\
So if I use solar panels.

Participant C 00:33:31.980 -- 00:33:35.620 \\
Get more energy and.

Participant C 00:33:37.540 -- 00:33:46.220 \\
Okay, I want to understand what's the difference between this growing stuff and the, the stuff next to it.

Participant C 00:33:47.780 -- 00:33:51.620
Because now I think, okay, if I use solar panels.

Participant C 00:33:53.540 -- 00:33:55.540
I can reduce the.

Participant C 00:33:56.740 -- 00:34:17.220
I can spend less money annually, but I need to also calculate how much money I need to invest to install those panels and how many years I need. I can get the money back. So I start to get this benefit the cost and benefits start going to be the same.

Participant C 00:34:17.860 -- 00:34:36.419
Now, as far as I see also you can see there are not many differences. So, solar panels could reach the energy. I need. I think it's like, this is the same, just telling me that the green is what the PV can produce as an energy.

Participant C 00:34:41.540 -- 00:34:43.940
I, I didn't really fully understand.

Participant C 00:34:45.379 -- 00:34:51.580
Or pv system can convert sunlight directly into electricity. Yes, that's, I know it.

Participant C 00:34:53.780 -- 00:34:57.540
The annual cost of five kilowatt peak is approximate.

Participant C 00:35:02.700 -- 00:35:07.100
This is caught. This is mean that this is the money I.

Participant C 00:35:14.460 -- 00:35:18.020
PV means so how many PV do I need.

Participant C 00:35:32.580 -- 00:35:34.660
Okay, so I need five.

Participant C 00:35:38.700 -- 00:35:40.420
I need five, not ten.

Participant C 00:35:49.620 -- 00:36:00.900
Can store it sees energy rarely by your solar panels. Ah, okay, so it saves it in a, in a battery like a tank like an energy tank, and then when I needed, they will give it to me. I also note this because.

Participant C 00:36:01.660 -- 00:36:16.900
I think my boyfriend's garden, we have this Sonar solar light and then they save it very small like this big, and then I save it, and at night, I can use it a whole night. So I know this battery system around twenty, what hours.

Participant C 00:36:29.780 -- 00:36:38.020
Systems, ah, okay, so it's like a smart detector or a smart AI that I can optimize managing usage.

Participant C 00:36:38.660 -- 00:36:43.140
Adjusting the heating ads is something like I just said in the very beginning of Bosch.

Participant C 00:36:43.780 -- 00:36:47.340
This is kind of artificial intelligence, which.

Participant C 00:36:48.260 -- 00:36:54.020
The systems, the technology that's used to generate heat in order to warm a space or provide hot water.

Participant C 00:36:57.860 -- 00:36:59.140
Yeah, that's what.

Participant C 00:37:00.420 -- 00:37:01.700
What is a heat pump.

Miao, Yanwei 00:37:08.740 -- 00:37:18.380
Like using electricity to boil the water or boil the, so it makes the space hot.

Miao, Yanwei 00:37:19.700 -- 00:37:26.820
Like natural gas, it's using gas to heat water or to keep the room hot.

Participant C 00:37:36.900 -- 00:37:50.020
This is very important. I really like the last one because a building renovations really can have a better sealing, like they, they still the house better. So the energy will not go out.

Participant C 00:37:52.260 -- 00:37:57.980
And you get, you, you can save a lot of money based on that, like.

Participant C 00:37:59.300 -- 00:38:02.740
And, and insulations of the windows, the doors.

Participant C 00:38:04.100 -- 00:38:18.500
Very old house. If like, I live in a very old house, the door and the window are very bad isolated. so no matter how, how much heating system you turn on the heat, anyway goes out. So.

Participant C 00:38:19.420 -- 00:38:23.620
You waste a lot of energy, but now the windows, if you buy it this new window.

Participant C 00:38:24.580 -- 00:38:25.540
More seal.

Participant C 00:38:27.180 -- 00:38:31.300
Week out, which is really important, but two thousand.

Participant C 00:38:32.300 -- 00:38:37.700
Not a, if I'm not an owner, I would definitely not do the dis decision on my.

Participant C 00:38:40.900 -- 00:38:46.020
Yeah, this is something cool. So what would I happen if I click on update, can I click?

Miao, Yanwei 00:38:46.260 -- 00:38:48.620
Sure you can do whatever.

Participant C 00:38:49.220 -- 00:38:55.620
So update means that, ah, okay, if I change something here and then I click on update and then they will change. I guess.

Participant C 00:38:56.900 -- 00:38:58.780
So let me change something.

Participant C 00:39:02.660 -- 00:39:03.940
Oh, cool, so.

Participant C 00:39:05.220 -- 00:39:10.260
Change it, and then this would change. So the heating would become.

Participant C 00:39:18.060 -- 00:39:19.940
What does this mean? Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:39:20.020 -- 00:39:21.860
Try to understand.

Participant C 00:39:21.860 -- 00:39:26.340
The technology user heat in order to, so.

Participant C 00:39:27.860 -- 00:39:48.100
I don't understand if I use this again, and then I spend this energy build is my money, and this is, this is the heating I, I need to use per energy in each month, but if I use this.

Participant C 00:39:48.740 -- 00:40:03.540
Which they suggest to me down here. I need to pay more and I use more heating systems. Why, why does adjust me a bad recommendation?

Miao, Yanwei 00:40:04.100 -- 00:40:07.300
It didn't suggest you, you change it yourself.

Participant C 00:40:07.660 -- 00:40:13.340
Oh, they suggest me, they suggest that I should use this.

Miao, Yanwei 00:40:14.980 -- 00:40:25.220
This might be a bug of mine. I shouldn't put that maybe if it didn't suggest you to change your heat pump, but yeah.

Participant C 00:40:25.500 -- 00:40:32.260
This is not a suggestion. This is just telling you that if you use this, the money would cost like this.

Participant C 00:40:35.540 -- 00:40:38.100
Which I already insert. I used this one.

Participant C 00:40:39.500 -- 00:40:44.500
It would cost, it didn't tell me the, the cost is, but anyway, it's lower.

Participant C 00:40:52.180 -- 00:40:55.380
Which means that I don't need to change it because it's kind of.

Participant C 00:40:57.340 -- 00:41:01.140
Efficient in my perspective compared to heat pomp.

Miao, Yanwei 00:41:01.140 -- 00:41:08.180
Right, it's not energy efficient, but it saves more money than changing to heat pump.

Participant C 00:41:08.180 -- 00:41:08.820
But.

Participant C 00:41:10.180 -- 00:41:15.300
But in a lot in the long term a heat pump, a better choice for me.

Miao, Yanwei 00:41:19.740 -- 00:41:30.740
Actually, from the model, it's calculated for you since it didn't recommend you. That means it's not a proper idea for you to change it.

Participant C 00:42:12.900 -- 00:42:16.660
That was done. Okay, now I fully understand.

Participant C 00:42:17.940 -- 00:42:28.820
This is the energy I need, and this is energy that after recommendation, they would give to me, so they produce more energy than that need.

Participant C 00:42:30.300 -- 00:42:42.260
With a lower cost. So that's why you said it's a cheaper and more efficient way in the end, and this is all the recommendation already. They choose it for me.

Participant C 00:42:42.260 -- 00:42:44.660
So I don't need to do any changes.

Participant C 00:42:46.340 -- 00:42:49.940
It becomes bad because that's the way they choose for me already.

Participant C 00:42:50.620 -- 00:42:54.420
But if anyway, I can, I can change it and then see what happens.

Participant C 00:42:55.580 -- 00:42:58.900
Not the best way because they are way changing for me.

Participant C 00:42:59.620 -- 00:43:06.580
Just leave it like this and produce a PF and take a look by the way, I was.

Participant C 00:43:07.260 -- 00:43:07.860
A few minutes a.

Participant C 00:43:09.780 -- 00:43:12.980
I was checking some energy stuff as well.

Miao, Yanwei 00:43:13.620 -- 00:43:14.260
Okay.

Participant C 00:43:14.420 -- 00:43:15.540
Because my thesis.

Participant C 00:43:17.500 -- 00:43:20.020
If you want to sell a house or you want to rent a house.

Participant C 00:43:20.860 -- 00:43:24.500
Energieausweis to provide you this energy else voice.

Miao, Yanwei 00:43:24.540 -- 00:43:26.420
Oh, really...

Participant C 00:43:26.660 -- 00:43:46.900
Yeah, and this Energieausweis is also like a report of how energy efficiency this houses and this, this done by a human, which is a professional, they go into your house and use the measurement to look at your windows everything in combinations and do a final report.

Participant C 00:43:48.180 -- 00:43:53.940
How energy efficiency or houses, and this is also done by the thermal camera, which I'm working on. So.

Miao, Yanwei 00:43:54.900 -- 00:43:55.220
Okay.

Participant C 00:43:55.380 -- 00:44:05.460
I think based on your work, it's also cheap because people don't have to act this professionally to come to your house and do this for you. Of course, it's more Preci.

Participant C 00:44:06.820 -- 00:44:13.140
I can also do it with your model and, and complete it by myself.

Participant C 00:44:13.780 -- 00:44:22.100
And then I can make a decision on my own or then I can refer to an expert that this is my first step, which I really like.

Participant C 00:44:24.660 -- 00:44:30.420
I can share with you what I just this one.

Miao, Yanwei 00:44:30.420 -- 00:44:31.540
Yes.

Participant C 00:44:31.700 -- 00:44:35.540
So this is the energy also in Germany.

Participant C 00:44:36.220 -- 00:44:38.100
This is a real one. This is not a fake one.

Participant C 00:44:38.900 -- 00:44:45.780
This is a house in a guisvi near Siegan and it's for sale and I'm checking for it because I think it's cool.

Participant C 00:44:46.700 -- 00:44:50.900
Big apartment you live alone. Have your own garden.

Participant C 00:44:51.540 -- 00:44:52.820
This is the.

Participant C 00:44:54.780 -- 00:44:56.660
Means like.

Participant C 00:44:58.660 -- 00:44:59.860
Get demand exactly.

Participant C 00:45:00.500 -- 00:45:01.780
And it's.

Participant C 00:45:02.420 -- 00:45:03.700
This, this range.

Participant C 00:45:04.340 -- 00:45:09.460
Yeah, the level. and also here are all the parameters they calculate.

Participant C 00:45:12.380 -- 00:45:16.500
It's in Germ, and this is very standard.

Participant C 00:45:18.700 -- 00:45:19.700
Where all the German.

Participant C 00:45:21.620 -- 00:45:22.260
They.

Participant C 00:45:23.100 -- 00:45:24.180
Will have this one.

Miao, Yanwei 00:45:24.500 -- 00:45:26.740
Can you send this picture to me?

Participant C 00:45:26.740 -- 00:45:27.380
Sure, sure.

Miao, Yanwei 00:45:27.580 -- 00:45:28.900
Thank you.

Miao, Yanwei 00:45:32.300 -- 00:45:39.380
This is, yeah, maybe it's a good inspiration for my.

Participant C 00:46:48.020 -- 00:46:53.140
And I think now I fully understand what it is, and I think it's very nice to have it because now.

Participant C 00:46:55.060 -- 00:46:57.620
Have to turn to these professional people.

Participant C 00:46:57.620 -- 00:47:02.740
I think they have a drop tribe. It's called Energy Consulting.

Participant C 00:47:03.660 -- 00:47:08.500
The consultant and I also talked to them as my interview is in my projects...

Participant C 00:47:09.780 -- 00:47:15.540
They do this for people, and then what they have to do is just do the calculations and generate this report.

Participant C 00:47:16.380 -- 00:47:21.940
Which have a national-wide standard, like, all the parameters have to be checked.

Participant C 00:47:22.580 -- 00:47:43.060
So let me see if there's anything else, why should we turn to renewable energy learn more about the reasons other than cost savings. Okay, so I think this is a topic that would share with me. I only not, I not only saving cost, but I only save some polar bears or.

Participant C 00:47:43.780 -- 00:47:50.100
Animals and also my future Simplings not simply is my notebooks. My children.

Participant C 00:47:57.260 -- 00:48:04.820
What damages have caused by okay, interesting. So this is not something I can click on, but these are some information I can look through.

Participant C 00:48:07.020 -- 00:48:10.420
I would like if there is some nice.

Participant C 00:48:11.940 -- 00:48:18.260
Nice pictures or link to, I can watch some horrible disasters about.

Participant C 00:48:18.900 -- 00:48:22.740
Didn't change it. No, I think it's good. like this, you.

Participant C 00:48:22.740 -- 00:48:27.340
And when I click on this, I go back again, I can start the, the.

Miao, Yanwei 00:48:28.620 -- 00:48:29.740
Everything.

Participant C 00:48:30.700 -- 00:48:33.620
Over again, and I really like this.

Participant C 00:48:34.260 -- 00:48:35.540
I really like this model.

Participant C 00:48:37.100 -- 00:48:38.700
What is this?

Participant C 00:48:40.100 -- 00:48:41.300
It's on the icon.

Miao, Yanwei 00:48:42.580 -- 00:48:48.340
When you come to the other, the project website.

Participant C 00:48:48.340 -- 00:48:49.980
Ah, okay.

Participant C 00:48:51.540 -- 00:48:52.820
Great, nice work.

Miao, Yanwei 00:48:52.820 -- 00:48:58.580
Thank you, all right, thank you. So you've tested the product.

Miao, Yanwei 00:49:00.100 -- 00:49:09.020
I would still like to ask you a bit more questions if you don't mind because it's already been a while.

Miao, Yanwei 00:49:11.380 -- 00:49:25.660
Okay, so I will continue asking a bit of questions like, sorry, give me a second. How do you feel about the recommendations provided to you?

Participant C 00:49:26.740 -- 00:49:46.580
At first, I was, I really like the concept, but for the interface I was a bit confused because I see the selections, right? I, I see the COMPU, the, the black box they selected for me, but I would have this intuition to think. Oh, should I select it, but then I understand that they already.

Participant C 00:49:46.980 -- 00:50:05.780
For me, so I don't have to think about which I should select just to see what they select from me and see the result, but the selection, the selecting functions confuse me that the computer is selected for me. I think I have do it on my own because it's kind of confusing feeling.

Miao, Yanwei 00:50:05.820 -- 00:50:06.420
Okay.

Participant C 00:50:06.620 -- 00:50:12.620
But I realize that when you explain to me that now they already give it to you. You just have to accept it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:50:13.460 -- 00:50:20.500
So do you forget that? you actually chose one of the recommendations when you came to this page.

Participant C 00:50:20.500 -- 00:50:21.780
I think I forgot... yeah.

Participant C 00:50:22.620 -- 00:50:34.580
I forgot, and also I think it's a bit confusing when you wrote something beneath it with the greater little text that said heat prompt is cost nine hundred euros.

Participant C 00:50:35.400 -- 00:50:50.120
I would think nine hundred years I don't know how much the gas thing I, I spent, so I would think maybe it's a recommendation for, for me. I should change it to that one. I think that the low text has this feeling for me. It's a good thing.

Participant C 00:50:50.840 -- 00:50:52.680
Stick to, but it's not.

Miao, Yanwei 00:50:53.320 -- 00:50:53.960
So.

Miao, Yanwei 00:50:55.480 -- 00:51:02.920
It was more like a usability thing. I shouldn't put it there if I- if the recommendation didn't ask you to change the heat pump.

Participant C 00:51:17.000 -- 00:51:18.880
And also I think.

Participant C 00:51:20.200 -- 00:51:24.040
I'm a user, I like to have this kind of responsive set.

Participant C 00:51:24.680 -- 00:51:34.920
Agreeing check that now it's everything you save better, but the interface gave me a feeling that it's everything, it's very neutral.

Participant C 00:51:34.960 -- 00:51:36.200
You know, everything.

Participant C 00:51:37.240 -- 00:51:40.040
I didn't feel the feeling of success.

Participant C 00:51:41.400 -- 00:51:42.600
Better person.

Participant C 00:51:42.600 -- 00:51:50.920
So, for example, you give me the selections which is not selecting saying recommendation.

Participant C 00:51:52.840 -- 00:51:54.760
See something more strong to say.

Participant C 00:51:55.440 -- 00:52:00.520
And help you save something, and then there's a big check.

Participant C 00:52:01.840 -- 00:52:08.200
Check it soft. The problem could be better like this, This improvement feeling is not visualized. So.

Participant C 00:52:08.920 -- 00:52:13.960
I know that this is something that can improve myself, but I understand it in a logical way.

Participant C 00:52:14.600 -- 00:52:17.640
It's emotional, I didn't really.

Participant C 00:52:19.080 -- 00:52:21.360
So the happen is, and improvement.

Participant C 00:52:22.480 -- 00:52:34.440
Kind of happiness that I achieved a better energy efficiency from an interface. I didn't mean that it's bad. I think it's good to be a neutral interface, but.

Participant C 00:52:35.080 -- 00:52:40.440
If there is something that needs to be a successful feeling.

Participant C 00:52:41.720 -- 00:52:44.680
It comparison because when I look at the two two charts...

Participant C 00:52:45.320 -- 00:52:48.520
The, left one is me, and the right one is the recommendation.

Participant C 00:52:49.800 -- 00:52:50.440
The two.

Participant C 00:52:51.720 -- 00:52:54.920
The two UI is very similar.

Miao, Yanwei 00:52:55.800 -- 00:52:56.200
I would.

Participant C 00:52:58.160 -- 00:53:00.680
Of course, I assume that the right one's better.

Participant C 00:53:02.040 -- 00:53:04.520
I didn't really feel.

Participant C 00:53:07.120 -- 00:53:09.640
The strong contrast I would say.

Miao, Yanwei 00:53:10.280 -- 00:53:10.920
Okay.

Participant C 00:53:10.920 -- 00:53:15.400
So I'm confused about, of course, I talk about the parameters of the.

Participant C 00:53:16.040 -- 00:53:18.960
Systems and the heating systems. I think.

Participant C 00:53:19.880 -- 00:53:23.720
You already choose Germany and I already said I don't use any cooling systems.

Miao, Yanwei 00:53:24.120 -- 00:53:24.360
Yes.

Participant C 00:53:24.360 -- 00:53:35.240
Then in the, in the last phases, they shouldn't talk about the cooling any more because no insert the parameters inside in the beginning.

Miao, Yanwei 00:53:35.480 -- 00:53:37.800
Could be like a model problem. I think.

Participant C 00:53:37.800 -- 00:53:47.400
And also about the, the water hot water. I think it should be also one of the questions to ask me.

Participant C 00:53:48.040 -- 00:53:55.160
The temperature I shower and the frequency I shower and also.

Participant C 00:53:58.280 -- 00:54:07.240
The seasonal changings, like if I do do your shower code in winter times, I think the question can be also a little bit more in detail because.

Participant C 00:54:08.040 -- 00:54:09.160
Behaviors.

Participant C 00:54:11.120 -- 00:54:12.360
Different season.

Participant C 00:54:13.680 -- 00:54:14.920
For example.

Participant C 00:54:15.680 -- 00:54:20.040
I think in the summertime in Germany or in the whole European countries.

Participant C 00:54:20.920 -- 00:54:23.880
More and we don't use that much light anymore.

Participant C 00:54:24.640 -- 00:54:29.640
I still turn it on. I know, but I mean, at some point we stop to use it for.

Participant C 00:54:30.320 -- 00:54:31.560
Longer time.

Participant C 00:54:34.120 -- 00:54:37.320
This also has to be into consideration that.

Participant C 00:54:38.320 -- 00:54:39.880
We use less energy.

Participant C 00:54:40.560 -- 00:54:44.360
I think you, you did, I saw that in summer times, the energy is last.

Miao, Yanwei 00:54:46.920 -- 00:54:53.960
Can I interpret this way? You actually don't trust the model so much, you think.

Miao, Yanwei 00:54:55.240 -- 00:55:11.120
Because you think different people's behaviors are different. So the big data they actually use for the model might not be so accurate, linked to your own. Yeah, like your personal behavior.

Participant C 00:55:12.520 -- 00:55:18.920
I would say so, but in the very beginning, when I start to use this model, my attitude is very.

Participant C 00:55:19.000 -- 00:55:22.120
Neutral and trust.

Participant C 00:55:23.000 -- 00:55:27.240
When I start to insert the questions, I also found it very good.

Participant C 00:55:27.440 -- 00:55:36.840
Then when I see the graphic, the confusion pushed me into. I don't trust it anymore. I, I, because there, there's too many flaws.

Participant C 00:55:37.480 -- 00:55:50.920
That it's very different from my own experiences and I already see the problem, I know that if there's a big miscalculation, then the whole money that I need to spend is definitely wrong then.

Participant C 00:55:52.000 -- 00:55:56.040
But if the big thing is I was very excited.

Participant C 00:55:56.680 -- 00:55:58.600
That it would be very precise.

Participant C 00:55:59.880 -- 00:56:04.960
And during the, when I really read each sections.

Participant C 00:56:06.320 -- 00:56:08.840
See that there must be some miscalculations.

Miao, Yanwei 00:56:10.760 -- 00:56:13.960
Okay, that makes very much sense.

Miao, Yanwei 00:56:15.440 -- 00:56:21.440
So would you still trust the recommendation that was recommended to you?

Participant C 00:56:22.600 -- 00:56:25.480
I think the main target.

Participant C 00:56:26.760 -- 00:56:31.880
For them to ask me to use this is asking me to buy their products, right?

Miao, Yanwei 00:56:32.520 -- 00:56:33.800
Buy those technologies?

Participant C 00:56:34.000 -- 00:56:42.120
Buy those technologies and I was thinking in this way, so it's not about trust this model or not. The.

Participant C 00:56:45.320 -- 00:56:49.800
Reason is not trusting the dee reason is they urge me to want to spend money.

Participant C 00:56:50.880 -- 00:56:51.720
Stuff.

Participant C 00:56:53.640 -- 00:57:01.960
Why do I think so. Because if I buy energy technology energy, efficiency technologies that help me to SA.

Participant C 00:57:04.560 -- 00:57:06.440
Promoted with this.

Participant C 00:57:08.360 -- 00:57:12.200
Website to tell me that. okay, if you buy.

Participant C 00:57:12.840 -- 00:57:17.960
If you use my product and you save a lot of energy, do you want to, but.

Participant C 00:57:18.680 -- 00:57:21.160
Customer already know their strategy.

Participant C 00:57:22.600 -- 00:57:39.080
For me, I would quickly check. Yeah, okay, and I, I would just want to check how good the products is efficient, and of course, I want to know how efficient this product fits to my own household of course, it's important.

Participant C 00:57:39.720 -- 00:57:40.360
So, so.

Miao, Yanwei 00:57:40.400 -- 00:57:48.680
So, so you think the website was created by some business people or like by some business brands?

Participant C 00:57:48.800 -- 00:57:51.240
I would say the website, it's more.

Participant C 00:57:53.880 -- 00:57:55.200
The product.

Miao, Yanwei 00:57:57.120 -- 00:58:06.600
This way, but actually if you, I saw you actually click on the, the new trans project.

Participant C 00:58:07.240 -- 00:58:08.520
Yeah, I did. That's why.

Miao, Yanwei 00:58:08.720 -- 00:58:14.800
And, and do you know the whole service was provided by Fraunhofer.

Miao, Yanwei 00:58:16.200 -- 00:58:21.320
And, you know, they are all research institutes, so there's no.

Participant C 00:58:21.360 -- 00:58:21.960
Money.

Miao, Yanwei 00:58:23.240 -- 00:58:26.400
Yes, like there are no companies that are involved.

Miao, Yanwei 00:58:27.760 -- 00:58:30.280
The Research Institute. So.

Miao, Yanwei 00:58:31.560 -- 00:58:39.240
Actually, no brands or no business. It's related to this project.

Participant C 00:58:39.600 -- 00:58:39.880
So.

Participant C 00:58:42.080 -- 00:58:46.800
It's more like the, the country is promoting.

Participant C 00:58:47.560 -- 00:58:50.760
Into a more greener place.

Participant C 00:58:51.520 -- 00:58:57.160
People to use gas or burn their calls anymore. Yeah, okay, so basically it's a good idea.

Participant C 00:59:01.680 -- 00:59:04.160
I think it's something.

Miao, Yanwei 00:59:06.120 -- 00:59:26.120
But, but that's in, that's very valuable. You're, you're inside there. So you think if it's, if it's by some business, then you think it's not just worthy, but if I tell you now they are research institutes and they are by the national German government and the EU.

Miao, Yanwei 00:59:26.600 -- 00:59:35.560
Do you still think it's, it's, it's not for promoting the products because they didn't even recommend you which brand to buy or which.

Miao, Yanwei 00:59:36.840 -- 00:59:45.000
Exactly which one to buy. They just say if you get a PV, you can back get the PV from any brands, anything anywhere.

Participant C 00:59:45.160 -- 00:59:46.280
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:59:47.160 -- 00:59:47.720
Trust voice.

Participant C 00:59:48.480 -- 01:00:01.160
Yeah, I would say my attitude would change a little bit from super skeptical to a little bit skeptical, then would test then I would test was my friend's house, which is super patty, an energy efficient.

Participant C 01:00:01.960 -- 01:00:05.000
And test it if they already did the passwork.

Participant C 01:00:05.640 -- 01:00:08.200
In, in this model still very bad, you know what I mean?

Participant C 01:00:08.840 -- 01:00:16.520
I want to know if this model in the end anyway, they will tell you that it's bad because if I already exert a very good parameters.

Participant C 01:00:17.200 -- 01:00:19.080
Like, highly energy efficient.

Participant C 01:00:21.360 -- 01:00:30.240
Tell me that you did a good job everything's, perfect, you don't need to buy the Sonar panels. I want to know this. I would test it in the model to see.

Participant C 01:00:31.240 -- 01:00:33.800
If I'm a super energy efficient.

Participant C 01:00:34.480 -- 01:00:42.120
They would say, Oh, now it's everything's good. You don't need any, any improvement if this is something like this in a model, I would trust it really a lot.

Miao, Yanwei 01:00:43.980 -- 01:00:49.100
You might just do, do the whole thing again.

Miao, Yanwei 01:00:49.860 -- 01:00:52.300
Beginning, and then you choose all the best option.

Participant C 01:00:56.900 -- 01:01:04.460
I want to see what, what would happen if I choose the best stop and then they still say, you have still have to buy a sort of panels.

Miao, Yanwei 01:01:06.380 -- 01:01:08.300
You can try it. Yes.

Participant C 01:01:08.340 -- 01:01:12.780
Okay, that's right. Another country I want to see if there's some difference.

Miao, Yanwei 01:01:13.060 -- 01:01:18.700
No, I, I only have touch land now. Sorry, but.

Miao, Yanwei 01:01:24.300 -- 01:01:29.300
I wonder like, why is your screen, Not showing those selections?

Participant C 01:01:30.060 -- 01:01:35.820
I don't know why it's okay when was the house built that me choose the most newest after.

Participant C 01:01:37.740 -- 01:01:44.500
Yes, how many people which one is the best.

Participant C 01:01:48.620 -- 01:01:54.380
So that you, oh, no, yeah, of course more is better because you share by more people or.

Miao, Yanwei 01:01:55.020 -- 01:01:56.940
Maybe I am not. So sure.

Participant C 01:01:57.020 -- 01:01:59.540
You have last week or you use last energy.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:00.980 -- 01:02:02.060
Could be.

Participant C 01:02:02.060 -- 01:02:02.700
But the energ...

Participant C 01:02:03.980 -- 01:02:06.540
It's talking about how many people per.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:06.540 -- 01:02:11.260
And it's for energy, I guess maybe more makes more sense. Yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:14.620 -- 01:02:16.780
Maybe he pump it's the best.

Participant C 01:02:16.780 -- 01:02:18.060
Okay, let's just keep.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:18.380 -- 01:02:18.700
Yeah.

Participant C 01:02:18.820 -- 01:02:19.980
Is it a hot water?

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:20.180 -- 01:02:22.460
Be having power tank.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:23.820 -- 01:02:33.540
Of course, a PV system, yes, no, you just said, yes, yes, and then choose the biggest one. The tank, you know what? yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:34.700 -- 01:02:40.460
And yes, a better system and a twenty kilow.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:43.260 -- 01:02:44.380
Yes.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:45.580 -- 01:02:47.620
And now you see.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:53.260 -- 01:02:57.740
Now you can still see your current energy bell, right?

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:58.380 -- 01:03:18.860
And then you will see the recommended configurations, which is it seems that your home energy system is already very technically economical and we do not have a recommendation that may lower energy future energy costs for you at the moment, but you can also see how different configurations.

Miao, Yanwei 01:03:18.900 -- 01:03:26.500
Will affect your house energy consumption by manually customizing your home energy system using our service.

Participant C 01:03:29.100 -- 01:03:31.020
So anyway they would tell me.

Miao, Yanwei 01:03:32.460 -- 01:03:34.340
Just give you whatever.

Participant C 01:03:38.700 -- 01:03:39.820
What.

Participant C 01:03:41.900 -- 01:03:44.460
Why is the energy bell, higher.

Miao, Yanwei 01:03:46.380 -- 01:03:48.940
Your current is the left one. You remember.

Participant C 01:03:50.260 -- 01:03:52.140
Why is the recommendation price higher?

Miao, Yanwei 01:03:52.780 -- 01:03:54.700
On the right one.

Miao, Yanwei 01:03:55.140 -- 01:03:59.460
Simulation if you go through, if you could scroll up.

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:01.100 -- 01:04:08.180
It's simulate, so you can just basically change everything the simulate to see what happened.

Participant C 01:04:12.820 -- 01:04:15.060
Can I change this simulate?

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:15.220 -- 01:04:20.300
You can change like, like here the simulation just give you a random thing.

Participant C 01:04:21.180 -- 01:04:22.540
I see.

Participant C 01:04:26.700 -- 01:04:31.140
Yeah, but I can change it. It's not from me.

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:31.460 -- 01:04:38.860
You remember the previous page already told you, like you can just go into check on whatever you want to see.

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:39.740 -- 01:04:42.020
No recommendation for you.

Participant C 01:04:42.700 -- 01:04:45.780
I see now I understand.

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:46.540 -- 01:04:47.660
Yes.

Participant C 01:04:48.460 -- 01:04:49.740
And it's just saying that's correct.

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:50.660 -- 01:04:51.780
Yes.

Participant C 01:04:52.740 -- 01:04:54.220
Nice, nice work.

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:55.500 -- 01:04:58.060
Now do you feel like you trusted a bit more.

Participant C 01:04:58.060 -- 01:04:58.700
Yeah, yeah.

Participant C 01:05:03.180 -- 01:05:04.460
At customer.

Miao, Yanwei 01:05:05.100 -- 01:05:24.940
No, you are good. You provide a lot of insights and, and okay, then I continue asking my questions. All right, are you considering investing in any of those recommended technologies? Like previously we have recommended some technolog.

Miao, Yanwei 01:05:25.220 -- 01:05:30.060
To you, would you consider investing them.

Participant C 01:05:30.060 -- 01:05:31.980
I have one questions regarding to your question.

Miao, Yanwei 01:05:32.100 -- 01:05:33.260
So, yes.

Participant C 01:05:33.900 -- 01:05:40.860
Investment means the money only to buy the technologies or including the installations.

Miao, Yanwei 01:05:42.860 -- 01:05:45.420
Investment means total.

Participant C 01:05:45.420 -- 01:05:46.700
Yeah, I understand.

Miao, Yanwei 01:05:49.900 -- 01:05:50.540
Would, would you like.

Miao, Yanwei 01:05:51.580 -- 01:05:59.500
Those technologies, if you see that they can actually have an impact on your energy Bill.

Participant C 01:06:00.140 -- 01:06:10.380
The government would pay would help me in certain present, if I try to save the, the whole world, buy my own money.

Participant C 01:06:11.220 -- 01:06:21.900
And I would think about it, but like, you know what I mean? If I buy a solar panel and then I can the government will pay at fifty percent for me. Not that much of me thirty percent.

Participant C 01:06:22.540 -- 01:06:25.100
I would really think about it.

Miao, Yanwei 01:06:25.100 -- 01:06:25.740
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 01:06:28.940 -- 01:06:30.860
All your, on your own.

Participant C 01:06:31.740 -- 01:06:37.900
Then I would still think about it, but not that like, really want to do it, like, still.

Participant C 01:06:39.180 -- 01:06:44.940
Because it really depends on how long I plan to live in this house.

Participant C 01:06:46.420 -- 01:06:50.700
If I am just a buyer of the house, for example, I buy this house.

Participant C 01:06:51.460 -- 01:06:51.980
Owner, but.

Participant C 01:06:55.180 -- 01:06:55.820
In two months.

Miao, Yanwei 01:06:55.860 -- 01:06:56.980
Okay.

Participant C 01:06:57.380 -- 01:07:01.580
Why do I have to do this investment? I didn't even get my money back and.

Miao, Yanwei 01:07:01.700 -- 01:07:11.420
Because you can sell it for more expensive price if you provide that your house, it's in the efficiency of level a.

Participant C 01:07:13.780 -- 01:07:16.940
Depends you have to calculate for me that.

Participant C 01:07:17.580 -- 01:07:20.780
Much much efficiency. I can really get the money.

Participant C 01:07:22.700 -- 01:07:23.820
But.

Miao, Yanwei 01:07:24.300 -- 01:07:28.060
Want to sell your house if you already bought this one.

Participant C 01:07:28.660 -- 01:07:37.420
I mean, if I change my working location, if I, I mean there's always something that I can switch my houses.

Participant C 01:07:38.260 -- 01:07:44.460
I sell it in this case, I would think about the investment, which is not fixed invest.

Participant C 01:07:46.260 -- 01:07:51.500
Means it's in a house, which, when I move off, it's, it belongs to the house.

Participant C 01:07:52.340 -- 01:08:03.020
All the recommendations from this MO model, it's fixed or fixed recommendations. It's not something like I do know in Taiwan when we.

Participant C 01:08:03.860 -- 01:08:05.580
On the AC, the air conditioner.

Participant C 01:08:06.940 -- 01:08:16.460
We can bring a lot of energy efficiency when you bring when you bought a certain kind of circulation fan a ventilatour.

Participant C 01:08:17.100 -- 01:08:18.380
And demonside.

Participant C 01:08:19.660 -- 01:08:29.900
Because if you buy this fan, it only costs two euros, Taiwanese dollars and it circulates the wind and cools the whole house down.

Participant C 01:08:30.700 -- 01:08:32.460
Using the same energy.

Participant C 01:08:33.740 -- 01:08:38.220
So if it's like this and I bought a fan and I move out, I can take it.

Participant C 01:08:38.220 -- 01:08:47.819
I would definitely do it like all the Tony's household. They do it, but the recommendation. now I got found this model is to really insert with such a high price.

Participant C 01:08:48.660 -- 01:08:49.740
I move out.

Participant C 01:08:50.380 -- 01:08:51.660
I don't even know. I can.

Participant C 01:08:51.940 -- 01:08:53.580
Solar panels with me.

Miao, Yanwei 01:08:53.700 -- 01:08:54.859
No, usually the.

Miao, Yanwei 01:08:55.580 -- 01:08:57.420
System they stay with the home. So.

Miao, Yanwei 01:08:59.339 -- 01:09:02.540
But yes, solar panels, You can actually bring with you.

Miao, Yanwei 01:09:03.180 -- 01:09:05.740
But it's just a lot of work.

Participant C 01:09:05.740 -- 01:09:25.580
I mean, oh, so in Germany that the installations causes very high. I think it's almost the same price as I bought. I don't know how much it cost, but in my imagination, it cost a lot. I bought this solo panels and also the installations of all the professional things...

Miao, Yanwei 01:09:26.299 -- 01:09:34.380
Makes sense, but what, if you don't want to move away, would you still invest in those technologies for your house?

Participant C 01:09:34.540 -- 01:09:39.660
Okay, it depends on my age. So if I'm going to, I'm like eighty years old. I'm going to die.

Participant C 01:09:40.980 -- 01:09:44.779
Why do I have to do this? Like, why, why?

Participant C 01:09:45.660 -- 01:09:47.339
My money in this, I'm already going to.

Miao, Yanwei 01:09:48.220 -- 01:09:58.500
Because for climate change, because for the environment, and because it actually can help you save energy bell, like, can help you save.

Miao, Yanwei 01:10:02.100 -- 01:10:02.700
Estimation.

Participant C 01:10:02.900 -- 01:10:09.740
Yeah, if I am forty years old, I will definitely be willing like, have enough money because I'm forty years old I have.

Participant C 01:10:10.460 -- 01:10:16.780
The investment I have my own host. Yeah, I would definitely do it, but if I'm like an old person, then it's.

Participant C 01:10:17.460 -- 01:10:33.420
It's still part of some, I wouldn't do it at all. So I think the focus group, the group that you focus, which would maybe very, very motivated is definitely not a students because they rent a house and they're definitely not a fresh man that just entered a society as working.

Participant C 01:10:35.340 -- 01:10:39.820
Someone who is in the middle of forty- two fifty and just retired got some money.

Participant C 01:10:40.460 -- 01:10:46.300
And if they are too old, they want, and also if you're just retired, you're thinking about.

Participant C 01:10:48.140 -- 01:10:51.340
And why are you making your house energy efficient?

Participant C 01:10:52.700 -- 01:10:54.540
Why like, why is the motive?

Miao, Yanwei 01:10:59.660 -- 01:11:16.940
You, you provide really good like perspective from this, from this like, angle, it's, it's really good. I really like it, and another question do you know why those recommendations were recommended to you?

Participant C 01:11:18.860 -- 01:11:30.980
Okay, because if there are five different ways of generating energy, there must be a best one which is more highly energy efficient.

Miao, Yanwei 01:11:32.340 -- 01:11:33.580
For your own situation?

Participant C 01:11:33.700 -- 01:11:37.900
Yeah, and the whole situation is based on the parameters, which I just insert.

Miao, Yanwei 01:11:38.060 -- 01:11:39.980
Okay, nice.

Participant C 01:11:39.980 -- 01:11:41.260
I have a question.

Participant C 01:11:42.060 -- 01:11:54.060
They didn't ask about my location more precisely regarding the landscape regarding the weather conditions regarding how big my whole apartment is.

Participant C 01:11:54.860 -- 01:12:03.020
Layer it is, because if I live on a third floor, like right now it's warmer and I need more cooling system for, if I have one.

Miao, Yanwei 01:12:03.780 -- 01:12:14.540
To answer the first question, your location question, we actually can provide very detailed, like, very just spot location.

Participant C 01:12:14.620 -- 01:12:15.740
Yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 01:12:16.540 -- 01:12:22.220
According to our model and the whole of Germany, it doesn't make a too big difference.

Participant C 01:12:22.220 -- 01:12:22.860
Oh, cool.

Participant C 01:12:23.500 -- 01:12:24.140
It's sup.

Miao, Yanwei 01:12:26.100 -- 01:12:31.180
But, you know, like, I know like many people want to know very precise detail.

Miao, Yanwei 01:12:32.620 -- 01:12:52.300
I could like, we could think of some ways, like some people might just want to do a quick scan so they can enter like some part of the, just they just need to enter Germany, but if you are very interested, knowing very, very detailed things we could even ask you like.

Miao, Yanwei 01:12:53.020 -- 01:13:11.500
Exactly and see again, you live and how many people there working habit is, are they working from home or are they working in the office and like those habits, how, what is your most comfortable temperature range?

Participant C 01:13:11.540 -- 01:13:13.420
Exactly, oh, I think.

Participant C 01:13:14.700 -- 01:13:17.900
The reason why it makes me a little bit untrust.

Participant C 01:13:19.260 -- 01:13:22.380
Also, because the, the question is something.

Participant C 01:13:23.660 -- 01:13:24.940
Close to my lifestyle.

Participant C 01:13:25.820 -- 01:13:29.420
Asking something about technologies equipment in my house.

Participant C 01:13:30.260 -- 01:13:47.980
Very far away from my life because I'm not an engineer, I'm a normal person. So this thing is more like you ask me what brand of fridge I bought which I don't care, but I care about if you're asking me my daily life habits, how often I show what temperatures make me feel comfortable.

Participant C 01:13:48.620 -- 01:13:57.580
I would feel like this is really personalized. So personalized feelings is like, this is more about me, but not only about the hardware and a house.

Participant C 01:13:58.500 -- 01:14:02.700
Person is also affecting how much energy consumption it is, right?

Miao, Yanwei 01:14:03.980 -- 01:14:11.020
But you think the, the final calculation was correct according to your current bill.

Participant C 01:14:11.020 -- 01:14:12.940
Yeah, that's surprisingly true.

Participant C 01:14:13.580 -- 01:14:18.700
I wasn't, I mean, I'm very critical and I want to see if it's true or not, and it's true.

Miao, Yanwei 01:14:19.980 -- 01:14:21.260
That's nice.

Miao, Yanwei 01:14:21.900 -- 01:14:25.740
I actually contribute to the, to your, to your trust a little bit.

Participant C 01:14:25.900 -- 01:14:27.020
Yeah, of course.

Miao, Yanwei 01:14:28.980 -- 01:14:36.620
So let me see. were you familiar with all those technologies before you use those systems?

Participant C 01:14:37.260 -- 01:14:45.580
No, because when I were doing a survey from this model, you have a lot of the descriptions and I think you, sa, you saw me.

Participant C 01:14:46.540 -- 01:14:52.620
Through everything a careful way, it doesn't mean that I, I want to do in a careful ways because I don't understand.

Miao, Yanwei 01:14:53.380 -- 01:15:00.940
So do you think after using the service you are more aware of what those technologies are actually for.

Participant C 01:15:01.100 -- 01:15:05.420
Yeah, I mean for awareness, of course, I, I aware it now.

Miao, Yanwei 01:15:05.420 -- 01:15:07.340
But more understanding.

Participant C 01:15:08.100 -- 01:15:09.900
Again, some understanding, yes, but.

Participant C 01:15:10.540 -- 01:15:12.460
If you test me right now. okay, what.

Participant C 01:15:13.740 -- 01:15:17.580
Something it means. I don't think I remember.

Miao, Yanwei 01:15:17.780 -- 01:15:24.620
Okay, but you can, if you don't remember what it means, you can always find the definition there.

Participant C 01:15:26.540 -- 01:15:33.580
So it's not something that I can immediately learn as knowledge, but it's something that I have something in my mind so.

Participant C 01:15:33.700 -- 01:15:34.220
I have.

Miao, Yanwei 01:15:35.060 -- 01:15:44.220
So do you, do you think like, overall you would say that you, your knowledge of those technologies improved a little bit after using it.

Participant C 01:15:44.700 -- 01:15:52.780
On a scale of one to ten of improvement, I would say is like one, two, four, like, not like one to ten, like.

Participant C 01:15:53.420 -- 01:15:54.700
For a lot.

Participant C 01:15:55.420 -- 01:16:09.420
Give me some time to look through like a Google myself, what technology it is. I really, I think this is like a base that motivates me to learn more about those energy efficiency tech.

Miao, Yanwei 01:16:09.420 -- 01:16:10.700
Technologies, yes.

Participant C 01:16:11.340 -- 01:16:19.020
But I really like that they didn't really explain me so much that make me feel annoyed, but it's like a intro.

Participant C 01:16:20.300 -- 01:16:22.860
Yeah, I brought understanding.

Miao, Yanwei 01:16:22.860 -- 01:16:26.500
So you think it's a good way doing this way.

Participant C 01:16:32.020 -- 01:16:35.020
Always want them to provide me some.

Participant C 01:16:36.940 -- 01:16:47.180
About reliable ones, because if I could go by myself, how do I know the information I, I check is, is correct and if you are based on an institute that do the research.

Participant C 01:16:47.220 -- 01:16:49.100
Exactly on this area.

Participant C 01:16:51.060 -- 01:16:59.340
Give me a, some links and videos which easier for me to learn more information if I really want to know what exactly this technology is about and.

Participant C 01:17:00.340 -- 01:17:08.940
Think about wow okay, This is really a nice cool technology and why don't I buy it and use it? It's good that you just only give me one.

Participant C 01:17:09.820 -- 01:17:12.780
General understanding of what that means, but.

Participant C 01:17:12.980 -- 01:17:14.700
Only helps me to do the survey.

Miao, Yanwei 01:17:14.820 -- 01:17:15.980
But it doesn't.

Participant C 01:17:15.980 -- 01:17:25.060
Help me to have a deeper understanding of the technology and also give me the motivation to really.

Participant C 01:17:26.380 -- 01:17:28.140
Fascinating and want to buy it.

Participant C 01:17:28.780 -- 01:17:39.020
The motions and I would say if you are doing a customer journey doing this process when I go through the prototype, then motions is very.

Participant C 01:17:40.380 -- 01:17:44.780
There's not really like a wow. Okay, so cool, like there.

Participant C 01:17:45.540 -- 01:17:46.700
Up and downs.

Participant C 01:17:47.340 -- 01:17:53.740
Annoyed or angry. No, but it's very flat and, and neutral if that's, what you want.

Miao, Yanwei 01:17:54.380 -- 01:18:01.420
Yes, actually, actually, that's partly like, because that's our, not our main focus.

Miao, Yanwei 01:18:02.740 -- 01:18:05.900
Do you remember when you first saw the PV.

Miao, Yanwei 01:18:06.740 -- 01:18:21.900
Green Bar and they actually exceed your demand remember, so isn't you feel surprised like, wow, actually the PV generated electricity. It's more than what I need.

Participant C 01:18:21.940 -- 01:18:22.540
I.

Participant C 01:18:23.340 -- 01:18:41.740
At that time I wasn't happy about it. I was just thinking about if it's like, I need money for eating and you give me more money than I need, and I would think why like, I don't need that much, so it's like you give me more energy, but I don't need that much. I, I, this is my life. This is my lifestyle.

Participant C 01:18:42.500 -- 01:18:44.940
This, isn't comfort for me. You give me more.

Participant C 01:18:45.580 -- 01:18:48.780
For, for what I.

Participant C 01:18:50.060 -- 01:18:55.820
I won't feel like, wow, it's so nice. I have more, I mean, it's energy, it's not money, It's, it's like...

Miao, Yanwei 01:18:56.580 -- 01:19:09.900
Maybe one thing I, I didn't, maybe if you don't know, it's, if you have a PV and if you generate more energy than you actually need.

Miao, Yanwei 01:19:11.220 -- 01:19:15.020
Yes, the electricity goes back to the grid.

Participant C 01:19:16.340 -- 01:19:17.460
Minus.

Miao, Yanwei 01:19:17.980 -- 01:19:19.500
You got minus user.

Participant C 01:19:19.700 -- 01:19:22.060
So in Taiwan, it's forbidden.

Participant C 01:19:23.340 -- 01:19:26.540
It's forbidden because you can pay less.

Miao, Yanwei 01:19:26.540 -- 01:19:36.780
Yes, that's, that's in Germany, it's the case that's why you pay less because these months you probably spend minus two hundred Euro for yours.

Participant C 01:19:37.460 -- 01:19:43.820
Exactly, I know this, I know this because in Taiwan, a lot of people put solar panels.

Participant C 01:19:44.660 -- 01:19:47.020
They got minus bills from the government.

Miao, Yanwei 01:19:47.660 -- 01:19:48.300
Yes.

Participant C 01:19:48.300 -- 01:19:49.580
Government's very angry.

Miao, Yanwei 01:19:50.220 -- 01:19:52.140
Really that's weird.

Participant C 01:19:52.140 -- 01:19:53.420
We're right, because.

Participant C 01:19:53.620 -- 01:20:03.660
Legal to put to insert and install. There are other panels on your own. You have to ask the government for permission and stuff. It's anyway, it's about.

Miao, Yanwei 01:20:03.660 -- 01:20:05.580
That's a different culture.

Miao, Yanwei 01:20:06.220 -- 01:20:19.020
Yes, but now do you feel more comfortable that, actually if you, they provide more, like, if PV generates more electricity and it actually gets your money, they use.

Participant C 01:20:20.940 -- 01:20:22.580
I'm happy.

Miao, Yanwei 01:20:22.860 -- 01:20:23.500
Okay...

Participant C 01:20:23.780 -- 01:20:31.180
I would like to know the extent like you, you said you said I can get some money back if it's like one or two cents.

Participant C 01:20:31.820 -- 01:20:36.940
And I really didn't see the difference if it's one, one or two hundred euros a month, then I see the difference.

Miao, Yanwei 01:20:37.620 -- 01:20:53.580
If you look at that table right now, you can see, like, for example, June or yeah, April, it's fine and the, the PV generates more than double of what your demand.

Miao, Yanwei 01:20:55.220 -- 01:21:04.180
So in the whole month, you, let's say if in June, you need to pay two hundred for your energy bill.

Miao, Yanwei 01:21:04.860 -- 01:21:14.100
That means you actually get minus four hundred Euro back. You get four hundred euro back.

Miao, Yanwei 01:21:16.340 -- 01:21:17.460
So.

Miao, Yanwei 01:21:19.660 -- 01:21:28.060
You definitely earn. That's why your energy bill like in the end was so low, it's only nine hundred for the whole year.

Miao, Yanwei 01:21:29.140 -- 01:21:30.420
Yes, yes, that's.

Participant C 01:21:30.540 -- 01:21:39.380
Satisfied, then I'm happy to, maybe I think after your explanations make me more motivated to install this technology.

Participant C 01:21:42.580 -- 01:21:47.700
I, I think I can save some money and also save the world and why not.

Miao, Yanwei 01:21:47.900 -- 01:21:59.860
Yes, yes, like the, the whole service was for making people realizing that actually you save a lot of money and you save the planet.

Miao, Yanwei 01:22:01.220 -- 01:22:17.140
But, but maybe we should provide more information to make you realize that it's, it's really hoping. Yeah, and I think it's also because like, for example, you, you're your background, it's a bit different, like in Taiwan, they, they can't just simply.

Miao, Yanwei 01:22:19.300 -- 01:22:24.820
So you probably have a different mindset of thinking of those extra energies.

Miao, Yanwei 01:22:25.780 -- 01:22:35.700
The Germans that I interviewed, they would quickly realize. Well, I can actually get that money back, so there's also some cultural background.

Miao, Yanwei 01:22:36.620 -- 01:22:38.260
Was doing something there.

Miao, Yanwei 01:22:38.900 -- 01:22:47.860
Yes, yes, but, but it's really really nice, to get those insights. So now do you believe in adopting those Techn.

Miao, Yanwei 01:22:49.780 -- 01:22:51.060
Energy cost.

Miao, Yanwei 01:22:54.260 -- 01:23:03.100
Yes, and those are all my questions for you. I'm so thankful that you spend so much time with me. One more hour.

Participant C 01:23:03.260 -- 01:23:03.860
Congratulation.

Miao, Yanwei 01:23:04.580 -- 01:23:14.700
Thank you so much. and it's really a lot of insights. I'm so grateful. All right, so happy that you admit it to, to come.

Miao, Yanwei 01:23:15.380 -- 01:23:17.860
Do you have any extra?

Miao, Yanwei 01:23:19.220 -- 01:23:28.060
Questions or thoughts or concerns regarding the whole interview or the system.

Participant C 01:23:30.460 -- 01:23:40.980
Because I think it's very interesting that you also consider that the Germans cares about data security and all the thing I insert is nothing critical.

Miao, Yanwei 01:23:42.940 -- 01:23:44.860
Yes, we did.

Participant C 01:23:46.380 -- 01:23:49.940
So something which I don't care about, but I think Germans care, so it's good.

Miao, Yanwei 01:23:53.780 -- 01:24:03.380
