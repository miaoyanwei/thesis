Miao, Yanwei 00:00:00.739 -- 00:00:15.500 \\
Okay, I think you have received the information that it's recording right now and for your demographical information, I would like to ask about your gender.

Participant B 00:00:16.100 -- 00:00:20.580 \\
A male.

Miao, Yanwei 00:02:17.700 -- 00:02:20.860 \\
Do you mind letting me know your age?

Participant B 00:02:20.940 -- 00:02:22.700 \\
30.

Miao, Yanwei 00:02:24.420 -- 00:02:29.700 \\
And your educational background.

Miao, Yanwei 00:02:40.100 -- 00:02:43.300 \\
And like, what, what did you study, what is your subject?

Participant B 00:02:43.340 -- 00:02:51.100 \\
So I started geography, which is the main topic and it was about environmental and climate change.

Miao, Yanwei 00:02:55.460 -- 00:02:59.020 \\
And your occupation right now.

Participant B 00:03:00.060 -- 00:03:03.740 \\
So I'm working for the ISI, It's like.

Participant B 00:03:06.740 -- 00:03:09.540 \\
I don't know the English expression actually, so it's wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiter.

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:15.660 -- 00:03:23.540 \\
Okay, that's, that's fine. And May, I know whether you have a bit of knowledge or interesting, AI.

Participant B 00:03:25.100 -- 00:03:28.820 \\
The first part of the thing was, was a little bit.

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:31.420 -- 00:03:35.780 \\
Do you have any knowledge or do you have any interest in AI?

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:37.060 -- 00:03:38.340 \\
Artificial intelligence.

Participant B 00:03:39.220 -- 00:03:49.220 \\
Not really no, not more than like, the, the basic interest in I just tried out the new tools which are available, but not more than that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:49.220 -- 00:03:55.980 \\
Okay, and do you have any knowledge or interest in the energy domain?

Participant B 00:03:57.180 -- 00:03:58.780 \\
Since I.

Participant B 00:04:00.180 -- 00:04:14.820 \\
A lot of time into researching for my masters thesis I have a little bit experience in the field of district heating and, and a wind power as I worked as a wind power company before.

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:15.460 -- 00:04:16.579 \\
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:19.299 -- 00:04:38.500 \\
Sounds good, thank you. So maybe also I would like to know something about your attitudes towards energy efficient technologies. Have you heard of energy efficient appliances or renewable energy technologies for households.

Participant B 00:04:44.300 -- 00:04:56.420 \\
So you mean like installation measures or new technologies regarding eat production or on water production. Something like that, or what do you mean?

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:56.500 -- 00:05:00.900 \\
Yes, basically like, very general, have you ever heard of any.

Miao, Yanwei 00:05:03.460 -- 00:05:13.660 \\
And have you ever considered implementing energy efficient technologies such as solar panels or smart thermostats.

Participant B 00:05:15.220 -- 00:05:34.180 \\
We're talking about installing smart term as we also have an electric car, we would like to use it to better plan the charging procedure, and then we also are talking about getting our roof insulated better insulation.

Participant B 00:05:34.940 -- 00:05:41.220 \\
It's hardly insulated now, but we want to increase the installation and.

Participant B 00:05:41.980 -- 00:05:47.500 \\
Also thinking about buying a footable tank.

Participant B 00:05:49.740 -- 00:05:56.860 \\
Tags, but the lack of money right now can afforded, but it's, we have plans for it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:05:57.220 -- 00:06:06.580 \\
Sounds good, and what is your understanding regarding the benefits of energy efficient technologies.

Participant B 00:06:10.100 -- 00:06:25.940 \\
Reduction of the needs. So we, we would need less energy consumed and obviously also for, for example, the roof insulation, it's in the summertime or during the winter, it's less.

Participant B 00:06:27.340 -- 00:06:32.420 \\
Strong changes in the room temperature, which is beneficial as well.

Miao, Yanwei 00:06:33.780 -- 00:06:39.140 \\
And do you know climate change And why is it important to individuals?

Miao, Yanwei 00:06:42.660 -- 00:06:55.060 \\
Climate change and why is climate change important for individuals to save energy or utilize renewable energy resources.

Participant B 00:06:55.820 -- 00:07:15.940 \\
You mean why it is important to everybody, and why everybody should, I think everybody should do what, what he or she can do in order to reduce their demand so that in, in total, the demand decreases and the targets, which are set for.

Participant B 00:07:16.140 -- 00:07:19.780 \\
For the entire community can be reached so...

Participant B 00:07:20.660 -- 00:07:23.220 \\
Play its small part. I think.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:25.700 -- 00:07:27.700 \\
Know a lot about that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:29.380 -- 00:07:38.180 \\
Sounds good, so I, I've already finished the pre-questions and now I will send you a link.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:39.860 -- 00:07:44.100 \\
You should have received a link in our chat now.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:46.660 -- 00:07:50.500 \\
If you click the link and then you are landing our service.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:53.060 -- 00:08:05.220 \\
And do you mind to share your screen so that I can see how you operate through the website, but if you don't want to eat, you can also just say no, and just let me know which step you are.

Miao, Yanwei 00:08:59.220 -- 00:09:03.540 \\
As long as it's comfortable for you to see, then it's fine.

Participant B 00:09:04.740 -- 00:09:06.580 \\
Okay, so.

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:09.860 -- 00:09:10.500 \\
You can think out loud.

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:11.900 -- 00:09:14.340 \\
When you are navigating through it.

Participant B 00:09:14.380 -- 00:09:22.660 \\
Okay, so, so what shall I look for shall. I look for like the UI or what, what is the main topic to look at?

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:23.300 -- 00:09:25.100 \\
Everything basically.

Participant B 00:09:25.300 -- 00:09:25.860 \\
Everything.

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:26.500 -- 00:09:30.220 \\
You can just share any thoughts when you are navigating.

Participant B 00:09:30.460 -- 00:09:34.780 \\
Great, so I like the look, it's really clean. That's the first impression.

Participant B 00:09:54.020 -- 00:09:56.780 \\
So I just need to select.

Participant B 00:10:01.700 -- 00:10:07.620 \\
So I think it's pretty straightforward. You, there's not much going on on the screen. I like that.

73
Participant B 00:10:40.660 -- 00:10:42.100 \\
Okay, so.

Participant B 00:10:48.340 -- 00:10:52.580 \\
Okay, so what's, what's the screen about?

Miao, Yanwei 00:11:02.460 -- 00:11:07.420 \\
You can ask me if you think you don't understand which part.

Participant B 00:11:07.540 -- 00:11:12.620 \\
So I, I will just click here to see more details how this calculated.

Participant B 00:11:16.500 -- 00:11:17.940 \\
Maybe I just.

Participant B 00:11:36.980 -- 00:11:41.700 \\
It's this for, for, it's for.

Participant B 00:11:42.780 -- 00:11:47.780 \\
An energy build, so this is for, and electricity.

Miao, Yanwei 00:11:50.420 -- 00:11:52.980 \\
You mean the price, the total price price.

Participant B 00:11:53.020 -- 00:11:53.620 \\
Yes, yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:11:53.940 -- 00:11:59.380 \\
For all the energy, your whole house could consume.

Participant B 00:12:00.820 -- 00:12:01.940 \\
So.

Participant B 00:12:04.260 -- 00:12:06.660 \\
And electricity might take.

Participant B 00:12:30.900 -- 00:12:32.020 \\
Yes, makes sense.

Participant B 00:12:39.060 -- 00:12:41.060 \\
So it's for.

Participant B 00:12:42.900 -- 00:12:54.020 \\
For electricity and, and leading. So I just just quickly checked, but it's, it's underestimating already price.

Participant B 00:12:58.060 -- 00:13:09.140 \\
Yeah, but I think it's because we have electric car and it doesn't ask if we have an electric car in charge at home. So our electricity Bill is alone is really high. so.

Participant B 00:13:10.420 -- 00:13:14.220 \\
Do not have then fuel costs other than the electricity.

Participant B 00:13:16.180 -- 00:13:26.500 \\
So maybe it could ask for a car if, if someone has a car, then should have a higher demand for electricity.

Participant B 00:13:52.020 -- 00:14:00.140 \\
Already it was not not that much for this. I only have the numbers for last year, so.

Participant B 00:14:06.740 -- 00:14:09.300 \\
It was like, they had electricity Bill of.

Participant B 00:14:14.580 -- 00:14:19.500 \\
Three thousand, six hundred, but that's only electricity.

Participant B 00:14:21.500 -- 00:14:22.820 \\
Also, gas.

Participant B 00:14:25.340 -- 00:14:31.300 \\
Whether he was one thousand eight hundred, so.

Participant B 00:14:55.380 -- 00:15:00.060 \\
Okay, and then on the right side, you see, I can see some suggestions.

Participant B 00:15:03.940 -- 00:15:05.940 \\
Let me check. Let's see.

Participant B 00:15:10.100 -- 00:15:20.980 \\
Annualized cost, okay, and does it also show, like total costs or it like the total investment costs.

Participant B 00:15:33.900 -- 00:15:35.700 \\
Yeah, that's good.

Participant B 00:16:33.940 -- 00:16:39.660 \\
IZED investment costs of two thousand something. Yes, so I would.

Participant B 00:16:41.660 -- 00:16:44.820 \\
In total, I would pay like a hundred more.

Participant B 00:16:45.860 -- 00:16:46.100 \\
Okay.

Participant B 00:17:13.740 -- 00:17:24.500 \\
Or will there be the, or is there going to be the opportunity to enter my own figures, like, if I- if I see, okay, this doesn't fit perfectly...

Participant B 00:17:25.339 -- 00:17:30.260 \\
Can I then alter the estimations to my demand, for example.

Miao, Yanwei 00:17:30.900 -- 00:17:38.580 \\
And you can click the more detail on the recommendation cards if you want to like, see one of these.

Participant B 00:17:38.580 -- 00:17:39.220 \\
Oh, okay.

Participant B 00:17:50.740 -- 00:17:53.540 \\
And you also program this website.

Participant B 00:17:57.780 -- 00:18:00.980 \\
It's really nice. I like, it's really clean.

Miao, Yanwei 00:18:03.580 -- 00:18:06.100 \\
Very happy, it's my first.

Participant B 00:18:06.260 -- 00:18:08.980 \\
No, I can. Yeah, I can.

Participant B 00:18:09.940 -- 00:18:12.500 \\
For example, take this away and then.

Participant B 00:18:13.820 -- 00:18:14.940 \\
Okay.

Participant B 00:18:48.340 -- 00:18:50.300 \\
Okay, that's cool.

Participant B 00:19:10.100 -- 00:19:15.860 \\
Yeah, I, I think this, this website looks as I said, it looks really good.

Participant B 00:19:19.700 -- 00:19:26.740 \\
That you can alter some things and, and see what it makes, what kind of differences it makes.

Participant B 00:19:34.420 -- 00:19:42.220 \\
That's really cool. And so what is, what is your plan going forward with this?

Miao, Yanwei 00:19:42.740 -- 00:19:52.980 \\
This is already actually.

Miao, Yanwei 00:19:53.860 -- 00:19:55.100 \\
The results.

Miao, Yanwei 00:19:58.100 -- 00:20:01.940 \\
Yeah, you've already reached the last phase.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:03.860 -- 00:20:20.500 \\
Thank you, and there's actually one more page, but it, you, you didn't notice it, but it's fine. It's for like, yes, it's the green bar. It says why should we turn to renewable energy?

Participant B 00:20:21.640 -- 00:20:24.440 \\
Before it was on the first page as well.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:24.680 -- 00:20:27.880 \\
Yes, but it.

Participant B 00:20:28.760 -- 00:20:32.360 \\
That's like a, like a FAQ for.

Participant B 00:20:33.640 -- 00:20:35.080 \\
Why it's important.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:35.560 -- 00:20:50.200 \\
Yes, it's for people who may want to the energy technologies, but they, they might mainly focus on the financial aspect.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:51.120 -- 00:21:00.520 \\
Provide a little bit more information regarding like climate change, so it's just, someone doesn't.

Participant B 00:21:03.720 -- 00:21:05.200 \\
That it's also.

Participant B 00:21:06.400 -- 00:21:13.800 \\
Issue of like the human society in its core and not only about the numbers.

Miao, Yanwei 00:21:17.160 -- 00:21:25.520 \\
But according to my research financial reason, it's still the main reasons for.

Miao, Yanwei 00:21:27.520 -- 00:21:29.800 \\
To choose their energy technologies.

Participant B 00:21:33.200 -- 00:21:44.040 \\
Especially in times where other energies are really expensive, it's, it would, or it could be a huge benefit to produce your own energy as well, and, and do.

Participant B 00:21:46.080 -- 00:22:04.640 \\
Something good with it as well. So I think it will always be, or it should be, maybe should be different than everybody should be doing it because it's better for the environment, but I think the, the main driver will still be the economics at the end.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:09.720 -- 00:22:14.120 \\
You have seen everything from the website, then.

Participant B 00:22:16.200 -- 00:22:17.320 \\
Fully.

Participant B 00:22:18.640 -- 00:22:25.000 \\
Haven't come fully into it now, but I can, I can do it via the link again and play around with.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:28.200 -- 00:22:39.080 \\
And now the port is eighty eighty, but maybe later we will remove the eighty eight port. We will make it global so that you don't need to type the eighty eighty in the end.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:40.400 -- 00:22:42.280 \\
Flex model dot org.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:44.200 -- 00:22:46.680 \\
And, but before.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:48.760 -- 00:23:08.400 \\
There are still some more questions after you operate with the system. Okay, I would still like to ask some questions regarding your attitude. So firstly, like, how do you feel about the recommended recommendations provided.

Participant B 00:23:09.800 -- 00:23:16.840 \\
So, as I already said in the beginning, we already thought about applying some of those recommend.

Participant B 00:23:20.320 -- 00:23:27.080 \\
In a sense, like at the moment, they're just too expensive to, to afford to implement, but.

Participant B 00:23:29.120 -- 00:23:47.040 \\
Fact that you get to play around with them and maybe you can, you can then check which size and you should go for or you get an idea at least, and then you can take that idea and go and look for solutions like technical solutions, for example, for Bettery size and the, the perfect.

Participant B 00:23:48.840 -- 00:24:06.120 \\
Recommendation for someone who can really put it in your home and then get get some offers about that thing, and then you have a number in mind, what, what we expect, I think that's a really good overview, if you are just starting, it's like the first step is go there.

Participant B 00:24:08.080 -- 00:24:13.800 \\
What can I do and how much will it be? Roughly, that's really good like that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:24:14.520 -- 00:24:30.440 \\
And, and you said you were worrying because you were worrying about the financial aspect, but after you seeing some of the recommendations where it says actually you will pay less every year.

Miao, Yanwei 00:24:31.120 -- 00:24:32.360 \\
Comparing to the.

Participant B 00:24:32.480 -- 00:24:38.760 \\
Well, the electric car you pay, you have to pay a little upfront and then you save.

Participant B 00:24:40.080 -- 00:24:53.000 \\
I think still the, the thing is to invest the money in the first place, you, you need to have some money to do the to do, So, so I think that's still.

Participant B 00:24:54.160 -- 00:25:00.520 \\
A little prevents many people from doing it. I think so, maybe they're.

Participant B 00:25:01.360 -- 00:25:04.880 \\
Be more easier accessible.

Participant B 00:25:07.560 -- 00:25:09.480 \\
How to say bottom.

Miao, Yanwei 00:25:09.480 -- 00:25:10.120 \\
Well, the big.

Participant B 00:25:10.400 -- 00:25:12.040 \\
Support from the government for.

Participant B 00:25:13.320 -- 00:25:13.960 \\
Yeah, yeah.

Participant B 00:25:13.960 -- 00:25:21.000 \\
So that, that people can do it more easily or even can pay for it on a monthly basis or something like...

Participant B 00:25:21.640 -- 00:25:27.840 \\
And that way it would be easier for, for many people to do it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:25:28.680 -- 00:25:37.000 \\
Yes, you are right? And do you find the recommendations useful or valuable?

Participant B 00:25:39.120 -- 00:25:49.160 \\
And I also, yeah, as I said, I like how it's presented it also. I think it plays a huge role, how you get the information back if it's like.

Participant B 00:25:50.640 -- 00:26:04.160 \\
If it's not like providing a good overview and it's like, you have to search for the results, then it will be, it will not be used. So I really like it that it's really clean and lightweight so to say.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:04.520 -- 00:26:07.640 \\
Thank you, so.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:09.760 -- 00:26:17.320 \\
What factors influence your decision to adopt or reject the recommendations. I think you just answered that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:19.240 -- 00:26:23.720 \\
And, you know, why the recommendations were recommended to you.

Participant B 00:26:25.080 -- 00:26:41.640 \\
Yeah, it depends on the, on the situation of the home. What would be interesting for me, for example, be like, but that's, I think that's too too deep for for a website, which ones just to make some recommendations to.

Participant B 00:26:42.360 -- 00:26:59.560 \\
Give you information to start with. Would then be like you need to know. Okay, is my building really, is it an option would be able to put a system on it because of the shape of the roof and stuff like that, but.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:06.000 -- 00:27:07.880 \\
More detailed information about.

Participant B 00:27:08.280 -- 00:27:24.520 \\
But I don't know how to apply to that website because then you would need to do them calculations on how your roof is suitable for a, for a photo TIG system and how much energy you could expect from it. For example.

Participant B 00:27:25.800 -- 00:27:32.960 \\
How large is the roof and what's the insulation and stuff? I think that's maybe out of scope.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:33.480 -- 00:27:47.560 \\
No, actually the model it provides everything, but during our first version we didn't put so much numbers in it so much data that you cannot change or you can adjust.

Participant B 00:27:48.240 -- 00:27:48.840 \\
Yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:48.840 -- 00:27:50.760 \\
But that's possible.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:51.560 -- 00:27:53.960 \\
Could be future work. Yes.

Participant B 00:27:53.960 -- 00:27:55.080 \\
So.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:55.920 -- 00:27:56.520 \\
Consider.

Participant B 00:27:56.560 -- 00:28:08.160 \\
It's really interesting, like, if it develops into a one stop opportunity to do all your calculations there. I really think that's a great thing.

Participant B 00:28:09.560 -- 00:28:16.360 \\
I work with a software for district heat planning and they also tried.

Participant B 00:28:19.600 -- 00:28:26.680 \\
Also really accelerates how people approach that. So I think that's a good thing to develop stuff like that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:28:27.880 -- 00:28:34.360 \\
I also believe so, and so you, do you trust the recommendations.

Participant B 00:28:35.880 -- 00:28:56.040 \\
Since for, for example, the first thing I rec, I noticed is that the only based on your, some of your questions and then the estimations were quite accurate now leaving behind that didn't ask for the car and that's why the recommendations don't fit perfectly, but I think.

Participant B 00:28:56.160 -- 00:29:12.680 \\
They are quite good other than that, so that makes very good impression. must be a good model behind it. So I think it's, it's good. I couldn't click on the details page on that for that, but I would like to see.

Participant B 00:29:14.720 -- 00:29:26.200 \\
Behind it, so not not for an end user, I think not the real detailed calculations, but like, split into the numbers, but probably you have that as well. So.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:26.760 -- 00:29:34.440 \\
You, you could also when you click the recommendation detail, you could also see the current data on the left side.

Participant B 00:29:34.720 -- 00:29:37.000 \\
Oh, okay, that was the current. yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:37.000 -- 00:29:37.640 \\
Yes, yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:41.480 -- 00:29:46.600 \\
Yeah, there, there's sort of like a comparison with your current situation. Yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:47.400 -- 00:29:58.800 \\
It was my fault that I've, I've only put all the links on the right side. I forgot it. I mean, thank you for, for noticing that, and I, I need to adapt my usability.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:02.840 -- 00:30:08.680 \\
I was considered also to be shown there of the current detail as well.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:12.200 -- 00:30:14.240 \\
Yes, and.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:15.520 -- 00:30:20.680 \\
What factors contribute to your trust or a lack of trust in the recommendations.

Participant B 00:30:24.060 -- 00:30:30.460 \\
So, yeah, as I said, in the first place, the numbers so that the estimations work, right? Quite correct. I think.

Participant B 00:30:32.460 -- 00:30:42.620 \\
That's the, the main reason why you can trusted if you, so, I mean, if you put in your personal data and then the calculation is quite accurate, then.

Participant B 00:30:43.540 -- 00:30:52.860 \\
Then you can rely on it in a sense that it will give you a recommendation that is not completely out of scope, like, then.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:52.900 -- 00:30:53.500 \\
Then you can.

Participant B 00:30:53.780 -- 00:31:13.980 \\
A little more and as well, what contribute, what contributes I think is the, the periods of the website is really well programmed and it works quickly smoothly. So I think that's also a part that plays an important role if you are a consumer that looks at the page and if it's.

Participant B 00:31:14.060 -- 00:31:31.900 \\
Responsive if it's not like too many options, but you can go through it very quickly. So then you will do it more likely than going through a website which takes you like two hours to complete and you will, you will never do that. So, but.

Participant B 00:31:32.700 -- 00:31:42.780 \\
Fast and responsive and looks looks good and is experiment explanations that are understandable for everyone. I think that's.

Participant B 00:31:43.420 -- 00:31:46.700 \\
A good contribution as well to trust it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:31:47.380 -- 00:31:51.020 \\
Thank you is understandable all those information provided.

Participant B 00:31:52.380 -- 00:32:12.220 \\
Yeah, at least for me, it was, but I, I'm also a little bit into the topic so I think for, for someone who owns the house and thought about it a while and has some, some of the vocabulary down, I think then it's no issue. I don't know how it.

Participant B 00:32:12.860 -- 00:32:17.340 \\
For someone who has never been in touch with a topic. I don't know, but.

Participant B 00:32:18.260 -- 00:32:22.020 \\
Doesn't seem too over complicated to me.

Miao, Yanwei 00:32:23.100 -- 00:32:30.140 \\
Great and, and did the system provide enough information for you to understand the technologies. You think.

Participant B 00:32:30.780 -- 00:32:50.620 \\
There's more descriptive text. I, I really like that as well there. I think it's better to have a small or short descriptive text that mentions the main things and not too much detail because then it also could make people not read it at all. if it's too long.

Participant B 00:32:50.620 -- 00:32:51.900 \\
So I think.

Participant B 00:32:53.180 -- 00:33:02.140 \\
It's a good balance between a short text information and keeping people on track and to do it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:33:03.540 -- 00:33:07.140 \\
Do you mean having some short.

Miao, Yanwei 00:33:08.620 -- 00:33:12.700 \\
Generalized information as well for the current technologies.

Participant B 00:33:15.660 -- 00:33:18.460 \\
Sorry, I didn't get the first part.

Participant B 00:33:41.220 -- 00:33:53.980 \\
My case is not because I already looked into it, but yeah, as I said, for someone who didn't have any contact with the topic before it might be the case, I don't know.

Miao, Yanwei 00:33:57.180 -- 00:34:14.460 \\
And maybe do you have anything you would like to share this is the last question, like, besides what I have asked you any extra thoughts about the system or anything can be IMPRO.

Participant B 00:34:17.659 -- 00:34:26.620 \\
Yeah, as I said, only the thing that you might want to enter your own figures like your own.

Participant B 00:34:27.540 -- 00:34:40.700 \\
Or the, the last, if you have a utilities, Bill and, you know, your demand you could enter it so that would make the calculations even better. I assume. so I think that would be an option for someone who.

Participant B 00:34:41.460 -- 00:34:45.940 \\
Wants to deprint it, and maybe you can also.

Participant B 00:34:47.740 -- 00:35:07.580 \\
Some values for, for offers you got from, from a company, for example, who wants to, to build your photobal tax system or something like that. Maybe you can put it into that into your system as well. Maybe that is also a good thing, but I think that's more for the advanced US.

Participant B 00:35:07.780 -- 00:35:10.780 \\
Some sort of thing like you really want.

Participant B 00:35:14.220 -- 00:35:18.980 \\
Assimulation to the, to the most accurate point, maybe.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:21.020 -- 00:35:24.860 \\
Maybe I'm trying to find out.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:27.420 -- 00:35:38.260 \\
Thank you so much. These are all the info, all the questions and I, I think we are actually, I'm, I'm three minutes exceeding my.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:39.620 -- 00:35:44.340 \\
But no, I'm sorry that I, I spent.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:48.740 -- 00:35:55.740 \\
It's really very informative information that I get from you and I, I would really like to show my appreciations.

Participant B 00:35:56.260 -- 00:35:56.860 \\
Thank you very.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:57.180 -- 00:35:58.140 \\
Thank you.
