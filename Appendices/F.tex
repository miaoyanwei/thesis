Miao, Yanwei 00:00:00.739 -- 00:00:15.500 \\
Okay, I think you have received the information that it's recording right now and for your demographical information, I would like to ask about your gender.

Participant B 00:00:16.100 -- 00:00:20.580 \\
A male.

Miao, Yanwei 00:02:17.700 -- 00:02:20.860 \\
Do you mind letting me know your age?

Participant B 00:02:20.940 -- 00:02:22.700 \\
30.

Miao, Yanwei 00:02:24.420 -- 00:02:29.700 \\
And your educational background.

Miao, Yanwei 00:02:40.100 -- 00:02:43.300 \\
And like, what, what did you study, what is your subject?

Participant B 00:02:43.340 -- 00:02:51.100 \\
So I started geography, which is the main topic and it was about environmental and climate change.

Miao, Yanwei 00:02:55.460 -- 00:02:59.020 \\
And your occupation right now.

Participant B 00:03:00.060 -- 00:03:03.740 \\
So I'm working for the ISI, It's like.

Participant B 00:03:06.740 -- 00:03:09.540 \\
I don't know the English expression actually, so it's wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiter.

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:15.660 -- 00:03:23.540 \\
Okay, that's, that's fine. And May, I know whether you have a bit of knowledge or interesting, AI.

Participant B 00:03:25.100 -- 00:03:28.820 \\
The first part of the thing was, was a little bit.

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:31.420 -- 00:03:35.780 \\
Do you have any knowledge or do you have any interest in AI?

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:37.060 -- 00:03:38.340 \\
Artificial intelligence.

Participant B 00:03:39.220 -- 00:03:49.220 \\
Not really no, not more than like, the, the basic interest in I just tried out the new tools which are available, but not more than that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:49.220 -- 00:03:55.980 \\
Okay, and do you have any knowledge or interest in the energy domain?

Participant B 00:03:57.180 -- 00:03:58.780 \\
Since I.

Participant B 00:04:00.180 -- 00:04:14.820 \\
A lot of time into researching for my masters thesis I have a little bit experience in the field of district heating and, and a wind power as I worked as a wind power company before.

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:15.460 -- 00:04:16.579 \\
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:19.299 -- 00:04:38.500 \\
Sounds good, thank you. So maybe also I would like to know something about your attitudes towards energy efficient technologies. Have you heard of energy efficient appliances or renewable energy technologies for households.

Participant B 00:04:44.300 -- 00:04:56.420 \\
So you mean like installation measures or new technologies regarding eat production or on water production. Something like that, or what do you mean?

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:56.500 -- 00:05:00.900 \\
Yes, basically like, very general, have you ever heard of any.

Miao, Yanwei 00:05:03.460 -- 00:05:13.660 \\
And have you ever considered implementing energy efficient technologies such as solar panels or smart thermostats.

Participant B 00:05:15.220 -- 00:05:34.180 \\
We're talking about installing smart term as we also have an electric car, we would like to use it to better plan the charging procedure, and then we also are talking about getting our roof insulated better insulation.

Participant B 00:05:34.940 -- 00:05:41.220 \\
It's hardly insulated now, but we want to increase the installation and.

Participant B 00:05:41.980 -- 00:05:47.500 \\
Also thinking about buying a footable tank.

Participant B 00:05:49.740 -- 00:05:56.860 \\
Tags, but the lack of money right now can afforded, but it's, we have plans for it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:05:57.220 -- 00:06:06.580 \\
Sounds good, and what is your understanding regarding the benefits of energy efficient technologies.

Participant B 00:06:10.100 -- 00:06:25.940 \\
Reduction of the needs. So we, we would need less energy consumed and obviously also for, for example, the roof insulation, it's in the summertime or during the winter, it's less.

Participant B 00:06:27.340 -- 00:06:32.420 \\
Strong changes in the room temperature, which is beneficial as well.

Miao, Yanwei 00:06:33.780 -- 00:06:39.140 \\
And do you know climate change And why is it important to individuals?

Miao, Yanwei 00:06:42.660 -- 00:06:55.060 \\
Climate change and why is climate change important for individuals to save energy or utilize renewable energy resources.

Participant B 00:06:55.820 -- 00:07:15.940 \\
You mean why it is important to everybody, and why everybody should, I think everybody should do what, what he or she can do in order to reduce their demand so that in, in total, the demand decreases and the targets, which are set for.

Participant B 00:07:16.140 -- 00:07:19.780 \\
For the entire community can be reached so...

Participant B 00:07:20.660 -- 00:07:23.220 \\
Play its small part. I think.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:25.700 -- 00:07:27.700 \\
Know a lot about that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:29.380 -- 00:07:38.180 \\
Sounds good, so I, I've already finished the pre-questions and now I will send you a link.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:39.860 -- 00:07:44.100 \\
You should have received a link in our chat now.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:46.660 -- 00:07:50.500 \\
If you click the link and then you are landing our service.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:53.060 -- 00:08:05.220 \\
And do you mind to share your screen so that I can see how you operate through the website, but if you don't want to eat, you can also just say no, and just let me know which step you are.

Miao, Yanwei 00:08:59.220 -- 00:09:03.540 \\
As long as it's comfortable for you to see, then it's fine.

Participant B 00:09:04.740 -- 00:09:06.580 \\
Okay, so.

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:09.860 -- 00:09:10.500 \\
You can think out loud.

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:11.900 -- 00:09:14.340 \\
When you are navigating through it.

Participant B 00:09:14.380 -- 00:09:22.660 \\
Okay, so, so what shall I look for shall. I look for like the UI or what, what is the main topic to look at?

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:23.300 -- 00:09:25.100 \\
Everything basically.

Participant B 00:09:25.300 -- 00:09:25.860 \\
Everything.

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:26.500 -- 00:09:30.220 \\
You can just share any thoughts when you are navigating.

Participant B 00:09:30.460 -- 00:09:34.780 \\
Great, so I like the look, it's really clean. That's the first impression.

Participant B 00:09:54.020 -- 00:09:56.780 \\
So I just need to select.

Participant B 00:10:01.700 -- 00:10:07.620 \\
So I think it's pretty straightforward. You, there's not much going on on the screen. I like that.

73
Participant B 00:10:40.660 -- 00:10:42.100 \\
Okay, so.

Participant B 00:10:48.340 -- 00:10:52.580 \\
Okay, so what's, what's the screen about?

Miao, Yanwei 00:11:02.460 -- 00:11:07.420 \\
You can ask me if you think you don't understand which part.

Participant B 00:11:07.540 -- 00:11:12.620 \\
So I, I will just click here to see more details how this calculated.

Participant B 00:11:16.500 -- 00:11:17.940 \\
Maybe I just.

Participant B 00:11:36.980 -- 00:11:41.700 \\
It's this for, for, it's for.

Participant B 00:11:42.780 -- 00:11:47.780 \\
An energy build, so this is for, and electricity.

Miao, Yanwei 00:11:50.420 -- 00:11:52.980 \\
You mean the price, the total price price.

Participant B 00:11:53.020 -- 00:11:53.620 \\
Yes, yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:11:53.940 -- 00:11:59.380 \\
For all the energy, your whole house could consume.

Participant B 00:12:00.820 -- 00:12:01.940 \\
So.

Participant B 00:12:04.260 -- 00:12:06.660 \\
And electricity might take.

Participant B 00:12:30.900 -- 00:12:32.020 \\
Yes, makes sense.

Participant B 00:12:39.060 -- 00:12:41.060 \\
So it's for.

Participant B 00:12:42.900 -- 00:12:54.020 \\
For electricity and, and leading. So I just just quickly checked, but it's, it's underestimating already price.

Participant B 00:12:58.060 -- 00:13:09.140 \\
Yeah, but I think it's because we have electric car and it doesn't ask if we have an electric car in charge at home. So our electricity Bill is alone is really high. so.

Participant B 00:13:10.420 -- 00:13:14.220 \\
Do not have then fuel costs other than the electricity.

Participant B 00:13:16.180 -- 00:13:26.500 \\
So maybe it could ask for a car if, if someone has a car, then should have a higher demand for electricity.

Participant B 00:13:52.020 -- 00:14:00.140 \\
Already it was not not that much for this. I only have the numbers for last year, so.

Participant B 00:14:06.740 -- 00:14:09.300 \\
It was like, they had electricity Bill of.

Participant B 00:14:14.580 -- 00:14:19.500 \\
Three thousand, six hundred, but that's only electricity.

Participant B 00:14:21.500 -- 00:14:22.820 \\
Also, gas.

Participant B 00:14:25.340 -- 00:14:31.300 \\
Whether he was one thousand eight hundred, so.

Participant B 00:14:55.380 -- 00:15:00.060 \\
Okay, and then on the right side, you see, I can see some suggestions.

Participant B 00:15:03.940 -- 00:15:05.940 \\
Let me check. Let's see.

Participant B 00:15:10.100 -- 00:15:20.980 \\
Annualized cost, okay, and does it also show, like total costs or it like the total investment costs.

Participant B 00:15:33.900 -- 00:15:35.700 \\
Yeah, that's good.

Participant B 00:16:33.940 -- 00:16:39.660 \\
IZED investment costs of two thousand something. Yes, so I would.

Participant B 00:16:41.660 -- 00:16:44.820 \\
In total, I would pay like a hundred more.

Participant B 00:16:45.860 -- 00:16:46.100 \\
Okay.

Participant B 00:17:13.740 -- 00:17:24.500 \\
Or will there be the, or is there going to be the opportunity to enter my own figures, like, if I- if I see, okay, this doesn't fit perfectly...

Participant B 00:17:25.339 -- 00:17:30.260 \\
Can I then alter the estimations to my demand, for example.

Miao, Yanwei 00:17:30.900 -- 00:17:38.580 \\
And you can click the more detail on the recommendation cards if you want to like, see one of these.

Participant B 00:17:38.580 -- 00:17:39.220 \\
Oh, okay.

Participant B 00:17:50.740 -- 00:17:53.540 \\
And you also program this website.

Participant B 00:17:57.780 -- 00:18:00.980 \\
It's really nice. I like, it's really clean.

Miao, Yanwei 00:18:03.580 -- 00:18:06.100 \\
Very happy, it's my first.

Participant B 00:18:06.260 -- 00:18:08.980 \\
No, I can. Yeah, I can.

Participant B 00:18:09.940 -- 00:18:12.500 \\
For example, take this away and then.

Participant B 00:18:13.820 -- 00:18:14.940 \\
Okay.

Participant B 00:18:48.340 -- 00:18:50.300 \\
Okay, that's cool.

Participant B 00:19:10.100 -- 00:19:15.860 \\
Yeah, I, I think this, this website looks as I said, it looks really good.

Participant B 00:19:19.700 -- 00:19:26.740 \\
That you can alter some things and, and see what it makes, what kind of differences it makes.

Participant B 00:19:34.420 -- 00:19:42.220 \\
That's really cool. And so what is, what is your plan going forward with this?

Miao, Yanwei 00:19:42.740 -- 00:19:52.980 \\
This is already actually.

Miao, Yanwei 00:19:53.860 -- 00:19:55.100 \\
The results.

Miao, Yanwei 00:19:58.100 -- 00:20:01.940 \\
Yeah, you've already reached the last phase.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:03.860 -- 00:20:20.500 \\
Thank you, and there's actually one more page, but it, you, you didn't notice it, but it's fine. It's for like, yes, it's the green bar. It says why should we turn to renewable energy?

Participant B 00:20:21.640 -- 00:20:24.440 \\
Before it was on the first page as well.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:24.680 -- 00:20:27.880 \\
Yes, but it.

Participant B 00:20:28.760 -- 00:20:32.360 \\
That's like a, like a FAQ for.

Participant B 00:20:33.640 -- 00:20:35.080 \\
Why it's important.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:35.560 -- 00:20:50.200 \\
Yes, it's for people who may want to the energy technologies, but they, they might mainly focus on the financial aspect.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:51.120 -- 00:21:00.520 \\
Provide a little bit more information regarding like climate change, so it's just, someone doesn't.

Participant B 00:21:03.720 -- 00:21:05.200 \\
That it's also.

Participant B 00:21:06.400 -- 00:21:13.800 \\
Issue of like the human society in its core and not only about the numbers.

Miao, Yanwei 00:21:17.160 -- 00:21:25.520 \\
But according to my research financial reason, it's still the main reasons for.

Miao, Yanwei 00:21:27.520 -- 00:21:29.800 \\
To choose their energy technologies.

Participant B 00:21:33.200 -- 00:21:44.040 \\
Especially in times where other energies are really expensive, it's, it would, or it could be a huge benefit to produce your own energy as well, and, and do.

Participant B 00:21:46.080 -- 00:22:04.640 \\
Something good with it as well. So I think it will always be, or it should be, maybe should be different than everybody should be doing it because it's better for the environment, but I think the, the main driver will still be the economics at the end.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:09.720 -- 00:22:14.120 \\
You have seen everything from the website, then.

Participant B 00:22:16.200 -- 00:22:17.320 \\
Fully.

Participant B 00:22:18.640 -- 00:22:25.000 \\
Haven't come fully into it now, but I can, I can do it via the link again and play around with.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:28.200 -- 00:22:39.080 \\
And now the port is eighty eighty, but maybe later we will remove the eighty eight port. We will make it global so that you don't need to type the eighty eighty in the end.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:40.400 -- 00:22:42.280 \\
Flex model dot org.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:44.200 -- 00:22:46.680 \\
And, but before.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:48.760 -- 00:23:08.400 \\
There are still some more questions after you operate with the system. Okay, I would still like to ask some questions regarding your attitude. So firstly, like, how do you feel about the recommended recommendations provided.

Participant B 00:23:09.800 -- 00:23:16.840 \\
So, as I already said in the beginning, we already thought about applying some of those recommend.

Participant B 00:23:20.320 -- 00:23:27.080 \\
In a sense, like at the moment, they're just too expensive to, to afford to implement, but.

Participant B 00:23:29.120 -- 00:23:47.040 \\
Fact that you get to play around with them and maybe you can, you can then check which size and you should go for or you get an idea at least, and then you can take that idea and go and look for solutions like technical solutions, for example, for Bettery size and the, the perfect.

Participant B 00:23:48.840 -- 00:24:06.120 \\
Recommendation for someone who can really put it in your home and then get get some offers about that thing, and then you have a number in mind, what, what we expect, I think that's a really good overview, if you are just starting, it's like the first step is go there.

Participant B 00:24:08.080 -- 00:24:13.800 \\
What can I do and how much will it be? Roughly, that's really good like that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:24:14.520 -- 00:24:30.440 \\
And, and you said you were worrying because you were worrying about the financial aspect, but after you seeing some of the recommendations where it says actually you will pay less every year.

Miao, Yanwei 00:24:31.120 -- 00:24:32.360 \\
Comparing to the.

Participant B 00:24:32.480 -- 00:24:38.760 \\
Well, the electric car you pay, you have to pay a little upfront and then you save.

Participant B 00:24:40.080 -- 00:24:53.000 \\
I think still the, the thing is to invest the money in the first place, you, you need to have some money to do the to do, So, so I think that's still.

Participant B 00:24:54.160 -- 00:25:00.520 \\
A little prevents many people from doing it. I think so, maybe they're.

Participant B 00:25:01.360 -- 00:25:04.880 \\
Be more easier accessible.

Participant B 00:25:07.560 -- 00:25:09.480 \\
How to say bottom.

Miao, Yanwei 00:25:09.480 -- 00:25:10.120 \\
Well, the big.

Participant B 00:25:10.400 -- 00:25:12.040 \\
Support from the government for.

Participant B 00:25:13.320 -- 00:25:13.960 \\
Yeah, yeah.

Participant B 00:25:13.960 -- 00:25:21.000 \\
So that, that people can do it more easily or even can pay for it on a monthly basis or something like...

Participant B 00:25:21.640 -- 00:25:27.840 \\
And that way it would be easier for, for many people to do it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:25:28.680 -- 00:25:37.000 \\
Yes, you are right? And do you find the recommendations useful or valuable?

Participant B 00:25:39.120 -- 00:25:49.160 \\
And I also, yeah, as I said, I like how it's presented it also. I think it plays a huge role, how you get the information back if it's like.

Participant B 00:25:50.640 -- 00:26:04.160 \\
If it's not like providing a good overview and it's like, you have to search for the results, then it will be, it will not be used. So I really like it that it's really clean and lightweight so to say.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:04.520 -- 00:26:07.640 \\
Thank you, so.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:09.760 -- 00:26:17.320 \\
What factors influence your decision to adopt or reject the recommendations. I think you just answered that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:19.240 -- 00:26:23.720 \\
And, you know, why the recommendations were recommended to you.

Participant B 00:26:25.080 -- 00:26:41.640 \\
Yeah, it depends on the, on the situation of the home. What would be interesting for me, for example, be like, but that's, I think that's too too deep for for a website, which ones just to make some recommendations to.

Participant B 00:26:42.360 -- 00:26:59.560 \\
Give you information to start with. Would then be like you need to know. Okay, is my building really, is it an option would be able to put a system on it because of the shape of the roof and stuff like that, but.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:06.000 -- 00:27:07.880 \\
More detailed information about.

Participant B 00:27:08.280 -- 00:27:24.520 \\
But I don't know how to apply to that website because then you would need to do them calculations on how your roof is suitable for a, for a photo TIG system and how much energy you could expect from it. For example.

Participant B 00:27:25.800 -- 00:27:32.960 \\
How large is the roof and what's the insulation and stuff? I think that's maybe out of scope.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:33.480 -- 00:27:47.560 \\
No, actually the model it provides everything, but during our first version we didn't put so much numbers in it so much data that you cannot change or you can adjust.

Participant B 00:27:48.240 -- 00:27:48.840 \\
Yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:48.840 -- 00:27:50.760 \\
But that's possible.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:51.560 -- 00:27:53.960 \\
Could be future work. Yes.

Participant B 00:27:53.960 -- 00:27:55.080 \\
So.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:55.920 -- 00:27:56.520 \\
Consider.

Participant B 00:27:56.560 -- 00:28:08.160 \\
It's really interesting, like, if it develops into a one stop opportunity to do all your calculations there. I really think that's a great thing.

Participant B 00:28:09.560 -- 00:28:16.360 \\
I work with a software for district heat planning and they also tried.

Participant B 00:28:19.600 -- 00:28:26.680 \\
Also really accelerates how people approach that. So I think that's a good thing to develop stuff like that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:28:27.880 -- 00:28:34.360 \\
I also believe so, and so you, do you trust the recommendations.

Participant B 00:28:35.880 -- 00:28:56.040 \\
Since for, for example, the first thing I rec, I noticed is that the only based on your, some of your questions and then the estimations were quite accurate now leaving behind that didn't ask for the car and that's why the recommendations don't fit perfectly, but I think.

Participant B 00:28:56.160 -- 00:29:12.680 \\
They are quite good other than that, so that makes very good impression. must be a good model behind it. So I think it's, it's good. I couldn't click on the details page on that for that, but I would like to see.

Participant B 00:29:14.720 -- 00:29:26.200 \\
Behind it, so not not for an end user, I think not the real detailed calculations, but like, split into the numbers, but probably you have that as well. So.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:26.760 -- 00:29:34.440 \\
You, you could also when you click the recommendation detail, you could also see the current data on the left side.

Participant B 00:29:34.720 -- 00:29:37.000 \\
Oh, okay, that was the current. yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:37.000 -- 00:29:37.640 \\
Yes, yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:41.480 -- 00:29:46.600 \\
Yeah, there, there's sort of like a comparison with your current situation. Yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:47.400 -- 00:29:58.800 \\
It was my fault that I've, I've only put all the links on the right side. I forgot it. I mean, thank you for, for noticing that, and I, I need to adapt my usability.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:02.840 -- 00:30:08.680 \\
I was considered also to be shown there of the current detail as well.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:12.200 -- 00:30:14.240 \\
Yes, and.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:15.520 -- 00:30:20.680 \\
What factors contribute to your trust or a lack of trust in the recommendations.

Participant B 00:30:24.060 -- 00:30:30.460 \\
So, yeah, as I said, in the first place, the numbers so that the estimations work, right? Quite correct. I think.

Participant B 00:30:32.460 -- 00:30:42.620 \\
That's the, the main reason why you can trusted if you, so, I mean, if you put in your personal data and then the calculation is quite accurate, then.

Participant B 00:30:43.540 -- 00:30:52.860 \\
Then you can rely on it in a sense that it will give you a recommendation that is not completely out of scope, like, then.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:52.900 -- 00:30:53.500 \\
Then you can.

Participant B 00:30:53.780 -- 00:31:13.980 \\
A little more and as well, what contribute, what contributes I think is the, the periods of the website is really well programmed and it works quickly smoothly. So I think that's also a part that plays an important role if you are a consumer that looks at the page and if it's.

Participant B 00:31:14.060 -- 00:31:31.900 \\
Responsive if it's not like too many options, but you can go through it very quickly. So then you will do it more likely than going through a website which takes you like two hours to complete and you will, you will never do that. So, but.

Participant B 00:31:32.700 -- 00:31:42.780 \\
Fast and responsive and looks looks good and is experiment explanations that are understandable for everyone. I think that's.

Participant B 00:31:43.420 -- 00:31:46.700 \\
A good contribution as well to trust it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:31:47.380 -- 00:31:51.020 \\
Thank you is understandable all those information provided.

Participant B 00:31:52.380 -- 00:32:12.220 \\
Yeah, at least for me, it was, but I, I'm also a little bit into the topic so I think for, for someone who owns the house and thought about it a while and has some, some of the vocabulary down, I think then it's no issue. I don't know how it.

Participant B 00:32:12.860 -- 00:32:17.340 \\
For someone who has never been in touch with a topic. I don't know, but.

Participant B 00:32:18.260 -- 00:32:22.020 \\
Doesn't seem too over complicated to me.

Miao, Yanwei 00:32:23.100 -- 00:32:30.140 \\
Great and, and did the system provide enough information for you to understand the technologies. You think.

Participant B 00:32:30.780 -- 00:32:50.620 \\
There's more descriptive text. I, I really like that as well there. I think it's better to have a small or short descriptive text that mentions the main things and not too much detail because then it also could make people not read it at all. if it's too long.

Participant B 00:32:50.620 -- 00:32:51.900 \\
So I think.

Participant B 00:32:53.180 -- 00:33:02.140 \\
It's a good balance between a short text information and keeping people on track and to do it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:33:03.540 -- 00:33:07.140 \\
Do you mean having some short.

Miao, Yanwei 00:33:08.620 -- 00:33:12.700 \\
Generalized information as well for the current technologies.

Participant B 00:33:15.660 -- 00:33:18.460 \\
Sorry, I didn't get the first part.

Participant B 00:33:41.220 -- 00:33:53.980 \\
My case is not because I already looked into it, but yeah, as I said, for someone who didn't have any contact with the topic before it might be the case, I don't know.

Miao, Yanwei 00:33:57.180 -- 00:34:14.460 \\
And maybe do you have anything you would like to share this is the last question, like, besides what I have asked you any extra thoughts about the system or anything can be IMPRO.

Participant B 00:34:17.659 -- 00:34:26.620 \\
Yeah, as I said, only the thing that you might want to enter your own figures like your own.

Participant B 00:34:27.540 -- 00:34:40.700 \\
Or the, the last, if you have a utilities, Bill and, you know, your demand you could enter it so that would make the calculations even better. I assume. so I think that would be an option for someone who.

Participant B 00:34:41.460 -- 00:34:45.940 \\
Wants to deprint it, and maybe you can also.

Participant B 00:34:47.740 -- 00:35:07.580 \\
Some values for, for offers you got from, from a company, for example, who wants to, to build your photobal tax system or something like that. Maybe you can put it into that into your system as well. Maybe that is also a good thing, but I think that's more for the advanced US.

Participant B 00:35:07.780 -- 00:35:10.780 \\
Some sort of thing like you really want.

Participant B 00:35:14.220 -- 00:35:18.980 \\
Assimulation to the, to the most accurate point, maybe.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:21.020 -- 00:35:24.860 \\
Maybe I'm trying to find out.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:27.420 -- 00:35:38.260 \\
Thank you so much. These are all the info, all the questions and I, I think we are actually, I'm, I'm three minutes exceeding my.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:39.620 -- 00:35:44.340 \\
But no, I'm sorry that I, I spent.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:48.740 -- 00:35:55.740 \\
It's really very informative information that I get from you and I, I would really like to show my appreciations.

Participant B 00:35:56.260 -- 00:35:56.860 \\
Thank you very.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:57.180 -- 00:35:58.140 \\
Thank you.

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:05.080 -- 00:15:11.280 \\
Before we begin, I would like to know some of your demographical information.

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:12.040 -- 00:15:24.080 \\
Don't mind, but if you mind, you could also just like, say that you don't want to provide such information. All right, so what is your gender?

Participant C 00:15:24.240 -- 00:15:25.360 \\
Female.

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:25.680 -- 00:15:27.400 \\
And your age.

Participant C 00:15:27.400 -- 00:15:29.120 \\
Twenty-eight.

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:29.320 -- 00:15:33.080 \\
And what is your major and your education?

Participant C 00:15:33.800 -- 00:15:35.600 \\
Major is.

Participant C 00:15:37.040 -- 00:15:43.400 \\
Human computer interactions in my masters, but industrial design is my bachelor.

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:43.400 -- 00:15:51.720 \\
Okay, the same with me and your occupation right now it's a master student, right?

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:53.000 -- 00:16:00.000 \\
And do you have any knowledge or do you have any interest in artificial intelligence?

Participant C 00:16:00.040 -- 00:16:02.680 \\
Not really not much.

Miao, Yanwei 00:16:03.880 -- 00:16:08.480 \\
And do you have knowledge or interest in energy domain?

Participant C 00:16:10.320 -- 00:16:16.920 \\
No, I would rate myself very low because I don't really know that much based on my background.

Miao, Yanwei 00:16:19.400 -- 00:16:28.840 \\
And I would like to know, have you heard of any energy efficient appliances or renewable energy technologies for households?

Participant C 00:16:30.200 -- 00:16:49.320 \\
As far as I know from my landlord and as Linda, where I left, they have artificial intelligent appliance on my, on our heater systems. So when the detector or the sensor. So called sensors, they sense that the degrees of seventeen degrees is more than in a row.

Participant C 00:16:49.480 -- 00:16:55.080 \\
For five days, they will switch completely off the heater for month.

Miao, Yanwei 00:16:55.280 -- 00:16:56.360 \\
Seventeen degrees.

Participant C 00:16:56.360 -- 00:16:57.640 \\
Yeah, for seventeen degrees.

Participant C 00:16:58.960 -- 00:17:18.520 \\
And I don't have seventeen or, or nine nineteen, but it's not over twenty. So when it's seventeen in a row and then they switch off the heating systems and then they will switch it on again in September. So this heating systems is totally controlled by the.

Participant C 00:17:19.400 -- 00:17:21.959 \\
Is not someone who set it off and.

Participant C 00:17:23.959 -- 00:17:27.959 \\
This year and Spring, we have the heating.

Miao, Yanwei 00:17:29.680 -- 00:17:30.280 \\
Which means.

Participant C 00:17:30.520 -- 00:17:36.680 \\
We don't have it even though the weather become like, eight degrees at night, the other day.

Participant C 00:17:37.400 -- 00:17:47.560 \\
We have the seventeen degrees in a row for a week and then the AI think. Oh, now it's very warm, but it's kind of a false detections. I would say.

Miao, Yanwei 00:17:52.040 -- 00:18:03.560 \\
Okay, and have you ever considered implementing energy efficient technologies such as solar panels and smarts and your home?

Participant C 00:18:03.560 -- 00:18:14.440 \\
Yes, I've heard one and, and Bosch, so it's very common that I think my colleagues they all buy this stuff, You can put it on your heat heater, turning stuff, you know, you can.

Participant C 00:18:15.200 -- 00:18:24.680 \\
And then you don't have to turn it. You just say I want the room always add twenty-one. Yeah, Celsius.

Participant C 00:18:25.480 -- 00:18:28.400 \\
They would help you to make it stable.

Miao, Yanwei 00:18:32.480 -- 00:18:34.920 \\
You also want to like, buy that thing.

Miao, Yanwei 00:18:35.080 -- 00:18:36.200 \\
For your home, if you.

Miao, Yanwei 00:18:38.160 -- 00:18:43.600 \\
And what is your understanding regarding the benefits of energy efficient technologies.

Participant C 00:18:47.080 -- 00:19:03.280 \\
I think it is in the compensation of human comfort and energy saving because if we always talk about saving savings, then we just don't use it, but I think Energy Savings should always in the balance of.

Participant C 00:19:05.720 -- 00:19:08.840 \\
Human comforts, like, you know what I mean? Yeah.

Participant C 00:19:11.400 -- 00:19:14.600 \\
But do you want me to say a definition of it? Or what, what's?

Participant C 00:19:15.320 -- 00:19:17.160 \\
Do you want me to answer from your question?

Miao, Yanwei 00:19:19.720 -- 00:19:26.720 \\
Overall, your understanding regarding the benefits of like, using such technologies.

Participant C 00:19:27.440 -- 00:19:30.600 \\
Then I would say it's more like...

Participant C 00:19:32.520 -- 00:19:33.720 \\
You, you.

Participant C 00:19:33.960 -- 00:19:42.760 \\
It's independent, it's not so not independent. It's dependent on the location. The weather condition, the wind.

Participant C 00:19:42.760 -- 00:19:51.720 \\
Or the Suns where the sun hits like the, the angle I mean, so it depends on this, and then you can make use of the.

Participant C 00:19:52.400 -- 00:20:12.840 \\
Nature resources in order to gain the last energy cost from your location, I would define like this, and I think it's very clever because I've heard that in Taiwan my country, a lot of people are promoting us to use the, the wave, the, the way.

Participant C 00:20:16.980 -- 00:20:19.540 \\
The water goes high and low. What's that called?

Participant C 00:20:22.740 -- 00:20:23.860 \\
Tide.

Participant C 00:20:24.860 -- 00:20:26.580 \\
Will go one, one month, like.

Participant C 00:20:28.100 -- 00:20:31.060 \\
And then the tide will go up to low, right?

Participant C 00:20:32.340 -- 00:20:35.460 \\
We make this into energy.

Participant C 00:20:37.460 -- 00:20:57.300 \\
Very efficient and it's also very clean, so we don't have to burn the call and I think every country or location have to think about what is the best way for them to produce energy, which is clean and efficient at the same time. So that's why I think it's good that.

Participant C 00:20:58.620 -- 00:20:59.860 \\
This, this stuff, so.

Participant C 00:21:00.500 -- 00:21:05.620 \\
Every single apartment or every single location has its.

Participant C 00:21:06.460 -- 00:21:08.820 \\
Encies like it's different.

Miao, Yanwei 00:21:13.300 -- 00:21:15.500 \\
So you, you think.

Miao, Yanwei 00:21:16.540 -- 00:21:20.820 \\
Those energy efficient technologies, they, they help.

Miao, Yanwei 00:21:22.260 -- 00:21:25.820 \\
They help like reduce energy use.

Participant C 00:21:26.740 -- 00:21:47.220 \\
No, I would say produced energy in a way that time the environment less. I wouldn't say that use less because if we want to reach a comfortable temperature or comfortable feeling, we need to use anyway at March of energy, right?

Participant C 00:21:48.740 -- 00:22:08.980 \\
Energy efficiency doesn't mean that we said, okay, now we don't switch on the heater anymore. It's that, we still have the comforts in winter times, but how do we make the energy in the most efficient way, how do we use it in the most efficient way or how do we produce it in a more, in most efficient way? So it's more like.

Participant C 00:22:10.900 -- 00:22:19.860 \\
Not compensate for our comforts, but we think about better solutions to reaching the goal of human comfort. I would say.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:20.860 -- 00:22:24.980 \\
For environmental protection, like the ultimate goal.

Participant C 00:22:25.620 -- 00:22:35.220 \\
Yeah, that's part of the goal, but in my perspective, the main goal is still we have, we, we don't compensate for our living quality.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:35.900 -- 00:22:36.500 \\
Yes.

Participant C 00:22:36.500 -- 00:22:39.060 \\
But we care about the environment of course.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:40.980 -- 00:22:57.460 \\
Make sense, okay, the last one before we start to use the service do you know, climate change and why is it important for individuals to save energy and utilize renewable energy sources?

Participant C 00:22:57.620 -- 00:23:04.020 \\
I heard about this topic of climate change when I was like, nine years old.

Participant C 00:23:05.460 -- 00:23:22.580 \\
A topic, I think a lot of movies and papers and people are talking about this that humans we imagine, we emissions a lot of co two on the globe, which is very bad and the global and the global become very warm.

Participant C 00:23:24.100 -- 00:23:26.420 \\
In the polar areas, the ice would meld.

Participant C 00:23:27.540 -- 00:23:38.580 \\
The land being less and less because the water would go higher and since we live on the island, it's possible that we would no longer be there anymore. So.

Participant C 00:23:39.380 -- 00:23:46.260 \\
When I was around nine or ten, I start to have this sense of global climate change stuff.

Participant C 00:23:47.540 -- 00:23:51.380 \\
Then may I know your question again.

Miao, Yanwei 00:23:53.500 -- 00:23:58.420 \\
It's do you know, climate change and why is it important for individuals?

Participant C 00:23:58.540 -- 00:24:00.340 \\
And I think I answered that two questions.

Miao, Yanwei 00:24:00.700 -- 00:24:06.500 \\
Yes, you did. Okay, so now I will send you a link.

Miao, Yanwei 00:24:09.940 -- 00:24:13.740 \\
And I will send it by chat.

Miao, Yanwei 00:24:16.340 -- 00:24:34.380 \\
Please open it with your browser and try to find those recommendations for your house. You can refer to the house that you, you currently are living in.

Participant C 00:24:35.540 -- 00:24:37.460 \\

This is a homepage of your home energy could be cheaper and greener. We help you decide what to invest in your home. Okay, so now I, I guess this is something that I can check of how energy efficient my house is...

Participant C 00:25:09.500 -- 00:25:29.940 \\
And then maybe I click on this to check if there's something. No, so I click on answer some questions in a few minutes, help us understand your current. Okay, this is like a survey to understand what might own houses and this is received personalized improvement.

Participant C 00:25:29.980 -- 00:25:34.060 \\
So this kind of some suggestions from the professional.

Participant C 00:25:35.060 -- 00:25:38.780 \\
Starting you agree to share you. Okay, yeah, start.

Participant C 00:25:42.740 -- 00:25:43.860 \\
Country.

Participant C 00:26:00.300 -- 00:26:01.900 \\
Right in German.

Participant C 00:26:07.700 -- 00:26:22.900 \\
Yes, when was the house built know the year of the house? Build can provide insight into its constructions. material such as compositions of the walls. Okay, I, as far as I know, our houses before.

Participant C 00:26:25.780 -- 00:26:32.140 \\
Has the house been renovated? Yes, renovation can include up, yes, exactly.

Participant C 00:26:34.580 -- 00:26:35.700 \\
Yes.

Participant C 00:26:37.140 -- 00:26:43.540 \\
How many people live in a house, So it's including my neighbors upstairs or only me, and my roommate?

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:44.220 -- 00:26:46.660 \\
It's everyone in the house.

Participant C 00:26:58.260 -- 00:27:02.020 \\
What type of heating system is used in a house?

Participant C 00:27:04.660 -- 00:27:13.620 \\
Biomass boiler district heating heat pump all the boiler. This one gas boiler.

Participant C 00:27:14.900 -- 00:27:28.340 \\
It's still a hot water tank in the house, a hot water tank or a space heating tank is a device that is used to store hot water for the domestic user to particular my boyfriend also used this one.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:28.380 -- 00:27:28.980 \\
Oh, okay.

Participant C 00:27:29.020 -- 00:27:29.620 \\
Yeah.

Participant C 00:27:31.540 -- 00:27:42.500 \\
It's a different one. Next, is there a PV system in a house, a PV system is a system that uses solar panels to convert online. No.

Participant C 00:27:44.340 -- 00:27:49.380 \\
Next a battery system, so energy is produced by Solavanos.

Participant C 00:27:50.100 -- 00:28:00.980 \\
Other sources to be used later when needed, we have a battery system for the House of heating up the water to the shower that is also c- included.

Miao, Yanwei 00:28:01.740 -- 00:28:04.180 \\
Yes, you can consider that.

Participant C 00:28:04.820 -- 00:28:12.620 \\
What is the capacity of this? I'm not so sure, but I guess it's the high, it's around this.

Participant C 00:28:15.700 -- 00:28:23.300 \\
Let me choose this one and see what would happen. Is there a smart energy management systems and a house?

Participant C 00:28:24.020 -- 00:28:25.940 \\
Otherwise consumption.

Participant C 00:28:27.220 -- 00:28:34.260 \\
I think definitely, yes, but it does not belong to me. It will also landlord because I think they definitely have one in the basement.

Participant C 00:28:35.220 -- 00:28:52.180 \\
Yes, okay, recommend. Oh, it's on the recommendation coming out your curr currently energy bills estimate to be wow three's for almost four thousand a year. So let me calculate four thousand.

Participant C 00:28:53.180 -- 00:28:59.220 \\
By twelve, which let me see. Let me calculate. that's a real.

Participant C 00:29:00.540 -- 00:29:05.620 \\
That is my payment so that I know how real this.

Participant C 00:29:10.180 -- 00:29:17.140 \\
Invited by twelve months and also depends on the summer and winter because wintertime always consume more energy.

Participant C 00:29:18.540 -- 00:29:22.900 \\
So each month re- okay, it's very, it's, it's very true.

Participant C 00:29:25.500 -- 00:29:45.300 \\
Systems battery system. Very good. It has a thing that shows me what I click on like an overview to check if I did something wrong, so I can change it five people household Germany. Okay, so if I lowest and investment in the flowing configurations are applied.

Participant C 00:29:45.460 -- 00:30:05.780 \\
The annual energy Bill is estimated B- two thousand. Let me see if there's more detail current. Yeah, it's cool that you also talk about the, month differences because of energy consumption during summer. It's any way lower.

Participant C 00:30:06.420 -- 00:30:12.180 \\
And that's why it went at times. I always like to Defin a house which have to post on me to.

Participant C 00:30:12.820 -- 00:30:26.260 \\
So you just only have to pay a certain range, but this heating cooling, ah, it also include cooling, but I don't have a cooling system. Why is it included?

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:28.740 -- 00:30:38.900 \\
To be honest, I'm not so sure, but this is how the model has calculated, but I noted it down, your confusion I will ask the expert.

Participant C 00:30:39.620 -- 00:30:48.580 \\
That's cool. Okay, so the hot water. Okay, so I think one thing it's very special for me, is that the hot water.

Participant C 00:30:49.860 -- 00:30:53.980 \\
Why is the hot water doesn't have any hot water.

Participant C 00:30:55.660 -- 00:30:57.220 \\
Winter times.

Participant C 00:31:06.500 -- 00:31:14.700 \\
And so weird home because in winter times you, you always shower hot, but in summer times you show a cold, sometimes I mean, sometimes.

Participant C 00:31:30.820 -- 00:31:35.300 \\
But I think in our house, the heating systems are heating systems.

Participant C 00:31:36.060 -- 00:31:44.260 \\
Water boilers with a water boiler. It's different energies and resources, and because the water border uses electricity.

Participant C 00:31:46.380 -- 00:31:48.100 \\
Systems use gas. So.

Participant C 00:31:48.740 -- 00:31:50.020 \\
Two different.

Participant C 00:31:51.940 -- 00:31:57.700 \\
But anyway, anyway, I, I just got confused by this graphic because.

Participant C 00:31:58.980 -- 00:32:18.820 \\
Of course, according to the system, doesn't exist in Germany or at least in my house and also the hot water should be more in December and January, February, March, April, May. Summertimes should be almost equal because we, as a female, we still shower, but not that warm.

Participant C 00:32:19.460 -- 00:32:20.740 \\
Still use it...

Participant C 00:32:21.380 -- 00:32:36.740 \\
According to this one, it's appliances. Okay, I think appliances, for example, like fridge is something that always takes up a lot of energy in our house.

Participant C 00:32:37.380 -- 00:32:57.860 \\
Open it through the year, but I, I learned from my dream roommate is that then Summertimes, we always switch the fridged into a cooler temperature. So we use less energy. I think that also makes a change because as far as I know the fridge is one of the best.

Participant C 00:32:59.420 -- 00:33:01.060 \\
A lot of energy resources.

Participant C 00:33:02.060 -- 00:33:22.180 \\
So I agree with this graphic and I want to see what it recommends me to do. Okay, this is just our estimation of my energy resources. I guess. So what can I do? This is my current one. I want to see what's gre PV means again, I think you, you have.

Participant C 00:33:22.300 -- 00:33:23.460 \\
Explain me in.

Miao, Yanwei 00:33:24.420 -- 00:33:27.940 \\
Yes, it's solar panels.

Participant C 00:33:29.020 -- 00:33:30.500 \\
So if I use solar panels.

Participant C 00:33:31.980 -- 00:33:35.620 \\
Get more energy and.

Participant C 00:33:37.540 -- 00:33:46.220 \\
Okay, I want to understand what's the difference between this growing stuff and the, the stuff next to it.

Participant C 00:33:47.780 -- 00:33:51.620
Because now I think, okay, if I use solar panels.

Participant C 00:33:53.540 -- 00:33:55.540
I can reduce the.

Participant C 00:33:56.740 -- 00:34:17.220
I can spend less money annually, but I need to also calculate how much money I need to invest to install those panels and how many years I need. I can get the money back. So I start to get this benefit the cost and benefits start going to be the same.

Participant C 00:34:17.860 -- 00:34:36.419
Now, as far as I see also you can see there are not many differences. So, solar panels could reach the energy. I need. I think it's like, this is the same, just telling me that the green is what the PV can produce as an energy.

Participant C 00:34:41.540 -- 00:34:43.940
I, I didn't really fully understand.

Participant C 00:34:45.379 -- 00:34:51.580
Or pv system can convert sunlight directly into electricity. Yes, that's, I know it.

Participant C 00:34:53.780 -- 00:34:57.540
The annual cost of five kilowatt peak is approximate.

Participant C 00:35:02.700 -- 00:35:07.100
This is caught. This is mean that this is the money I.

Participant C 00:35:14.460 -- 00:35:18.020
PV means so how many PV do I need.

Participant C 00:35:32.580 -- 00:35:34.660
Okay, so I need five.

Participant C 00:35:38.700 -- 00:35:40.420
I need five, not ten.

Participant C 00:35:49.620 -- 00:36:00.900
Can store it sees energy rarely by your solar panels. Ah, okay, so it saves it in a, in a battery like a tank like an energy tank, and then when I needed, they will give it to me. I also note this because.

Participant C 00:36:01.660 -- 00:36:16.900
I think my boyfriend's garden, we have this Sonar solar light and then they save it very small like this big, and then I save it, and at night, I can use it a whole night. So I know this battery system around twenty, what hours.

Participant C 00:36:29.780 -- 00:36:38.020
Systems, ah, okay, so it's like a smart detector or a smart AI that I can optimize managing usage.

Participant C 00:36:38.660 -- 00:36:43.140
Adjusting the heating ads is something like I just said in the very beginning of Bosch.

Participant C 00:36:43.780 -- 00:36:47.340
This is kind of artificial intelligence, which.

Participant C 00:36:48.260 -- 00:36:54.020
The systems, the technology that's used to generate heat in order to warm a space or provide hot water.

Participant C 00:36:57.860 -- 00:36:59.140
Yeah, that's what.

Participant C 00:37:00.420 -- 00:37:01.700
What is a heat pump.

Miao, Yanwei 00:37:08.740 -- 00:37:18.380
Like using electricity to boil the water or boil the, so it makes the space hot.

Miao, Yanwei 00:37:19.700 -- 00:37:26.820
Like natural gas, it's using gas to heat water or to keep the room hot.

Participant C 00:37:36.900 -- 00:37:50.020
This is very important. I really like the last one because a building renovations really can have a better sealing, like they, they still the house better. So the energy will not go out.

Participant C 00:37:52.260 -- 00:37:57.980
And you get, you, you can save a lot of money based on that, like.

Participant C 00:37:59.300 -- 00:38:02.740
And, and insulations of the windows, the doors.

Participant C 00:38:04.100 -- 00:38:18.500
Very old house. If like, I live in a very old house, the door and the window are very bad isolated. so no matter how, how much heating system you turn on the heat, anyway goes out. So.

Participant C 00:38:19.420 -- 00:38:23.620
You waste a lot of energy, but now the windows, if you buy it this new window.

Participant C 00:38:24.580 -- 00:38:25.540
More seal.

Participant C 00:38:27.180 -- 00:38:31.300
Week out, which is really important, but two thousand.

Participant C 00:38:32.300 -- 00:38:37.700
Not a, if I'm not an owner, I would definitely not do the dis decision on my.

Participant C 00:38:40.900 -- 00:38:46.020
Yeah, this is something cool. So what would I happen if I click on update, can I click?

Miao, Yanwei 00:38:46.260 -- 00:38:48.620
Sure you can do whatever.

Participant C 00:38:49.220 -- 00:38:55.620
So update means that, ah, okay, if I change something here and then I click on update and then they will change. I guess.

Participant C 00:38:56.900 -- 00:38:58.780
So let me change something.

Participant C 00:39:02.660 -- 00:39:03.940
Oh, cool, so.

Participant C 00:39:05.220 -- 00:39:10.260
Change it, and then this would change. So the heating would become.

Participant C 00:39:18.060 -- 00:39:19.940
What does this mean? Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:39:20.020 -- 00:39:21.860
Try to understand.

Participant C 00:39:21.860 -- 00:39:26.340
The technology user heat in order to, so.

Participant C 00:39:27.860 -- 00:39:48.100
I don't understand if I use this again, and then I spend this energy build is my money, and this is, this is the heating I, I need to use per energy in each month, but if I use this.

Participant C 00:39:48.740 -- 00:40:03.540
Which they suggest to me down here. I need to pay more and I use more heating systems. Why, why does adjust me a bad recommendation?

Miao, Yanwei 00:40:04.100 -- 00:40:07.300
It didn't suggest you, you change it yourself.

Participant C 00:40:07.660 -- 00:40:13.340
Oh, they suggest me, they suggest that I should use this.

Miao, Yanwei 00:40:14.980 -- 00:40:25.220
This might be a bug of mine. I shouldn't put that maybe if it didn't suggest you to change your heat pump, but yeah.

Participant C 00:40:25.500 -- 00:40:32.260
This is not a suggestion. This is just telling you that if you use this, the money would cost like this.

Participant C 00:40:35.540 -- 00:40:38.100
Which I already insert. I used this one.

Participant C 00:40:39.500 -- 00:40:44.500
It would cost, it didn't tell me the, the cost is, but anyway, it's lower.

Participant C 00:40:52.180 -- 00:40:55.380
Which means that I don't need to change it because it's kind of.

Participant C 00:40:57.340 -- 00:41:01.140
Efficient in my perspective compared to heat pomp.

Miao, Yanwei 00:41:01.140 -- 00:41:08.180
Right, it's not energy efficient, but it saves more money than changing to heat pump.

Participant C 00:41:08.180 -- 00:41:08.820
But.

Participant C 00:41:10.180 -- 00:41:15.300
But in a lot in the long term a heat pump, a better choice for me.

Miao, Yanwei 00:41:19.740 -- 00:41:30.740
Actually, from the model, it's calculated for you since it didn't recommend you. That means it's not a proper idea for you to change it.

Participant C 00:42:12.900 -- 00:42:16.660
That was done. Okay, now I fully understand.

Participant C 00:42:17.940 -- 00:42:28.820
This is the energy I need, and this is energy that after recommendation, they would give to me, so they produce more energy than that need.

Participant C 00:42:30.300 -- 00:42:42.260
With a lower cost. So that's why you said it's a cheaper and more efficient way in the end, and this is all the recommendation already. They choose it for me.

Participant C 00:42:42.260 -- 00:42:44.660
So I don't need to do any changes.

Participant C 00:42:46.340 -- 00:42:49.940
It becomes bad because that's the way they choose for me already.

Participant C 00:42:50.620 -- 00:42:54.420
But if anyway, I can, I can change it and then see what happens.

Participant C 00:42:55.580 -- 00:42:58.900
Not the best way because they are way changing for me.

Participant C 00:42:59.620 -- 00:43:06.580
Just leave it like this and produce a PF and take a look by the way, I was.

Participant C 00:43:07.260 -- 00:43:07.860
A few minutes a.

Participant C 00:43:09.780 -- 00:43:12.980
I was checking some energy stuff as well.

Miao, Yanwei 00:43:13.620 -- 00:43:14.260
Okay.

Participant C 00:43:14.420 -- 00:43:15.540
Because my thesis.

Participant C 00:43:17.500 -- 00:43:20.020
If you want to sell a house or you want to rent a house.

Participant C 00:43:20.860 -- 00:43:24.500
Energieausweis to provide you this energy else voice.

Miao, Yanwei 00:43:24.540 -- 00:43:26.420
Oh, really...

Participant C 00:43:26.660 -- 00:43:46.900
Yeah, and this Energieausweis is also like a report of how energy efficiency this houses and this, this done by a human, which is a professional, they go into your house and use the measurement to look at your windows everything in combinations and do a final report.

Participant C 00:43:48.180 -- 00:43:53.940
How energy efficiency or houses, and this is also done by the thermal camera, which I'm working on. So.

Miao, Yanwei 00:43:54.900 -- 00:43:55.220
Okay.

Participant C 00:43:55.380 -- 00:44:05.460
I think based on your work, it's also cheap because people don't have to act this professionally to come to your house and do this for you. Of course, it's more Preci.

Participant C 00:44:06.820 -- 00:44:13.140
I can also do it with your model and, and complete it by myself.

Participant C 00:44:13.780 -- 00:44:22.100
And then I can make a decision on my own or then I can refer to an expert that this is my first step, which I really like.

Participant C 00:44:24.660 -- 00:44:30.420
I can share with you what I just this one.

Miao, Yanwei 00:44:30.420 -- 00:44:31.540
Yes.

Participant C 00:44:31.700 -- 00:44:35.540
So this is the energy also in Germany.

Participant C 00:44:36.220 -- 00:44:38.100
This is a real one. This is not a fake one.

Participant C 00:44:38.900 -- 00:44:45.780
This is a house in a guisvi near Siegan and it's for sale and I'm checking for it because I think it's cool.

Participant C 00:44:46.700 -- 00:44:50.900
Big apartment you live alone. Have your own garden.

Participant C 00:44:51.540 -- 00:44:52.820
This is the.

Participant C 00:44:54.780 -- 00:44:56.660
Means like.

Participant C 00:44:58.660 -- 00:44:59.860
Get demand exactly.

Participant C 00:45:00.500 -- 00:45:01.780
And it's.

Participant C 00:45:02.420 -- 00:45:03.700
This, this range.

Participant C 00:45:04.340 -- 00:45:09.460
Yeah, the level. and also here are all the parameters they calculate.

Participant C 00:45:12.380 -- 00:45:16.500
It's in Germ, and this is very standard.

Participant C 00:45:18.700 -- 00:45:19.700
Where all the German.

Participant C 00:45:21.620 -- 00:45:22.260
They.

Participant C 00:45:23.100 -- 00:45:24.180
Will have this one.

Miao, Yanwei 00:45:24.500 -- 00:45:26.740
Can you send this picture to me?

Participant C 00:45:26.740 -- 00:45:27.380
Sure, sure.

Miao, Yanwei 00:45:27.580 -- 00:45:28.900
Thank you.

Miao, Yanwei 00:45:32.300 -- 00:45:39.380
This is, yeah, maybe it's a good inspiration for my.

Participant C 00:46:48.020 -- 00:46:53.140
And I think now I fully understand what it is, and I think it's very nice to have it because now.

Participant C 00:46:55.060 -- 00:46:57.620
Have to turn to these professional people.

Participant C 00:46:57.620 -- 00:47:02.740
I think they have a drop tribe. It's called Energy Consulting.

Participant C 00:47:03.660 -- 00:47:08.500
The consultant and I also talked to them as my interview is in my projects...

Participant C 00:47:09.780 -- 00:47:15.540
They do this for people, and then what they have to do is just do the calculations and generate this report.

Participant C 00:47:16.380 -- 00:47:21.940
Which have a national-wide standard, like, all the parameters have to be checked.

Participant C 00:47:22.580 -- 00:47:43.060
So let me see if there's anything else, why should we turn to renewable energy learn more about the reasons other than cost savings. Okay, so I think this is a topic that would share with me. I only not, I not only saving cost, but I only save some polar bears or.

Participant C 00:47:43.780 -- 00:47:50.100
Animals and also my future Simplings not simply is my notebooks. My children.

Participant C 00:47:57.260 -- 00:48:04.820
What damages have caused by okay, interesting. So this is not something I can click on, but these are some information I can look through.

Participant C 00:48:07.020 -- 00:48:10.420
I would like if there is some nice.

Participant C 00:48:11.940 -- 00:48:18.260
Nice pictures or link to, I can watch some horrible disasters about.

Participant C 00:48:18.900 -- 00:48:22.740
Didn't change it. No, I think it's good. like this, you.

Participant C 00:48:22.740 -- 00:48:27.340
And when I click on this, I go back again, I can start the, the.

Miao, Yanwei 00:48:28.620 -- 00:48:29.740
Everything.

Participant C 00:48:30.700 -- 00:48:33.620
Over again, and I really like this.

Participant C 00:48:34.260 -- 00:48:35.540
I really like this model.

Participant C 00:48:37.100 -- 00:48:38.700
What is this?

Participant C 00:48:40.100 -- 00:48:41.300
It's on the icon.

Miao, Yanwei 00:48:42.580 -- 00:48:48.340
When you come to the other, the project website.

Participant C 00:48:48.340 -- 00:48:49.980
Ah, okay.

Participant C 00:48:51.540 -- 00:48:52.820
Great, nice work.

Miao, Yanwei 00:48:52.820 -- 00:48:58.580
Thank you, all right, thank you. So you've tested the product.

Miao, Yanwei 00:49:00.100 -- 00:49:09.020
I would still like to ask you a bit more questions if you don't mind because it's already been a while.

Miao, Yanwei 00:49:11.380 -- 00:49:25.660
Okay, so I will continue asking a bit of questions like, sorry, give me a second. How do you feel about the recommendations provided to you?

Participant C 00:49:26.740 -- 00:49:46.580
At first, I was, I really like the concept, but for the interface I was a bit confused because I see the selections, right? I, I see the COMPU, the, the black box they selected for me, but I would have this intuition to think. Oh, should I select it, but then I understand that they already.

Participant C 00:49:46.980 -- 00:50:05.780
For me, so I don't have to think about which I should select just to see what they select from me and see the result, but the selection, the selecting functions confuse me that the computer is selected for me. I think I have do it on my own because it's kind of confusing feeling.

Miao, Yanwei 00:50:05.820 -- 00:50:06.420
Okay.

Participant C 00:50:06.620 -- 00:50:12.620
But I realize that when you explain to me that now they already give it to you. You just have to accept it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:50:13.460 -- 00:50:20.500
So do you forget that? you actually chose one of the recommendations when you came to this page.

Participant C 00:50:20.500 -- 00:50:21.780
I think I forgot... yeah.

Participant C 00:50:22.620 -- 00:50:34.580
I forgot, and also I think it's a bit confusing when you wrote something beneath it with the greater little text that said heat prompt is cost nine hundred euros.

Participant C 00:50:35.400 -- 00:50:50.120
I would think nine hundred years I don't know how much the gas thing I, I spent, so I would think maybe it's a recommendation for, for me. I should change it to that one. I think that the low text has this feeling for me. It's a good thing.

Participant C 00:50:50.840 -- 00:50:52.680
Stick to, but it's not.

Miao, Yanwei 00:50:53.320 -- 00:50:53.960
So.

Miao, Yanwei 00:50:55.480 -- 00:51:02.920
It was more like a usability thing. I shouldn't put it there if I- if the recommendation didn't ask you to change the heat pump.

Participant C 00:51:17.000 -- 00:51:18.880
And also I think.

Participant C 00:51:20.200 -- 00:51:24.040
I'm a user, I like to have this kind of responsive set.

Participant C 00:51:24.680 -- 00:51:34.920
Agreeing check that now it's everything you save better, but the interface gave me a feeling that it's everything, it's very neutral.

Participant C 00:51:34.960 -- 00:51:36.200
You know, everything.

Participant C 00:51:37.240 -- 00:51:40.040
I didn't feel the feeling of success.

Participant C 00:51:41.400 -- 00:51:42.600
Better person.

Participant C 00:51:42.600 -- 00:51:50.920
So, for example, you give me the selections which is not selecting saying recommendation.

Participant C 00:51:52.840 -- 00:51:54.760
See something more strong to say.

Participant C 00:51:55.440 -- 00:52:00.520
And help you save something, and then there's a big check.

Participant C 00:52:01.840 -- 00:52:08.200
Check it soft. The problem could be better like this, This improvement feeling is not visualized. So.

Participant C 00:52:08.920 -- 00:52:13.960
I know that this is something that can improve myself, but I understand it in a logical way.

Participant C 00:52:14.600 -- 00:52:17.640
It's emotional, I didn't really.

Participant C 00:52:19.080 -- 00:52:21.360
So the happen is, and improvement.

Participant C 00:52:22.480 -- 00:52:34.440
Kind of happiness that I achieved a better energy efficiency from an interface. I didn't mean that it's bad. I think it's good to be a neutral interface, but.

Participant C 00:52:35.080 -- 00:52:40.440
If there is something that needs to be a successful feeling.

Participant C 00:52:41.720 -- 00:52:44.680
It comparison because when I look at the two two charts...

Participant C 00:52:45.320 -- 00:52:48.520
The, left one is me, and the right one is the recommendation.

Participant C 00:52:49.800 -- 00:52:50.440
The two.

Participant C 00:52:51.720 -- 00:52:54.920
The two UI is very similar.

Miao, Yanwei 00:52:55.800 -- 00:52:56.200
I would.

Participant C 00:52:58.160 -- 00:53:00.680
Of course, I assume that the right one's better.

Participant C 00:53:02.040 -- 00:53:04.520
I didn't really feel.

Participant C 00:53:07.120 -- 00:53:09.640
The strong contrast I would say.

Miao, Yanwei 00:53:10.280 -- 00:53:10.920
Okay.

Participant C 00:53:10.920 -- 00:53:15.400
So I'm confused about, of course, I talk about the parameters of the.

Participant C 00:53:16.040 -- 00:53:18.960
Systems and the heating systems. I think.

Participant C 00:53:19.880 -- 00:53:23.720
You already choose Germany and I already said I don't use any cooling systems.

Miao, Yanwei 00:53:24.120 -- 00:53:24.360
Yes.

Participant C 00:53:24.360 -- 00:53:35.240
Then in the, in the last phases, they shouldn't talk about the cooling any more because no insert the parameters inside in the beginning.

Miao, Yanwei 00:53:35.480 -- 00:53:37.800
Could be like a model problem. I think.

Participant C 00:53:37.800 -- 00:53:47.400
And also about the, the water hot water. I think it should be also one of the questions to ask me.

Participant C 00:53:48.040 -- 00:53:55.160
The temperature I shower and the frequency I shower and also.

Participant C 00:53:58.280 -- 00:54:07.240
The seasonal changings, like if I do do your shower code in winter times, I think the question can be also a little bit more in detail because.

Participant C 00:54:08.040 -- 00:54:09.160
Behaviors.

Participant C 00:54:11.120 -- 00:54:12.360
Different season.

Participant C 00:54:13.680 -- 00:54:14.920
For example.

Participant C 00:54:15.680 -- 00:54:20.040
I think in the summertime in Germany or in the whole European countries.

Participant C 00:54:20.920 -- 00:54:23.880
More and we don't use that much light anymore.

Participant C 00:54:24.640 -- 00:54:29.640
I still turn it on. I know, but I mean, at some point we stop to use it for.

Participant C 00:54:30.320 -- 00:54:31.560
Longer time.

Participant C 00:54:34.120 -- 00:54:37.320
This also has to be into consideration that.

Participant C 00:54:38.320 -- 00:54:39.880
We use less energy.

Participant C 00:54:40.560 -- 00:54:44.360
I think you, you did, I saw that in summer times, the energy is last.

Miao, Yanwei 00:54:46.920 -- 00:54:53.960
Can I interpret this way? You actually don't trust the model so much, you think.

Miao, Yanwei 00:54:55.240 -- 00:55:11.120
Because you think different people's behaviors are different. So the big data they actually use for the model might not be so accurate, linked to your own. Yeah, like your personal behavior.

Participant C 00:55:12.520 -- 00:55:18.920
I would say so, but in the very beginning, when I start to use this model, my attitude is very.

Participant C 00:55:19.000 -- 00:55:22.120
Neutral and trust.

Participant C 00:55:23.000 -- 00:55:27.240
When I start to insert the questions, I also found it very good.

Participant C 00:55:27.440 -- 00:55:36.840
Then when I see the graphic, the confusion pushed me into. I don't trust it anymore. I, I, because there, there's too many flaws.

Participant C 00:55:37.480 -- 00:55:50.920
That it's very different from my own experiences and I already see the problem, I know that if there's a big miscalculation, then the whole money that I need to spend is definitely wrong then.

Participant C 00:55:52.000 -- 00:55:56.040
But if the big thing is I was very excited.

Participant C 00:55:56.680 -- 00:55:58.600
That it would be very precise.

Participant C 00:55:59.880 -- 00:56:04.960
And during the, when I really read each sections.

Participant C 00:56:06.320 -- 00:56:08.840
See that there must be some miscalculations.

Miao, Yanwei 00:56:10.760 -- 00:56:13.960
Okay, that makes very much sense.

Miao, Yanwei 00:56:15.440 -- 00:56:21.440
So would you still trust the recommendation that was recommended to you?

Participant C 00:56:22.600 -- 00:56:25.480
I think the main target.

Participant C 00:56:26.760 -- 00:56:31.880
For them to ask me to use this is asking me to buy their products, right?

Miao, Yanwei 00:56:32.520 -- 00:56:33.800
Buy those technologies?

Participant C 00:56:34.000 -- 00:56:42.120
Buy those technologies and I was thinking in this way, so it's not about trust this model or not. The.

Participant C 00:56:45.320 -- 00:56:49.800
Reason is not trusting the dee reason is they urge me to want to spend money.

Participant C 00:56:50.880 -- 00:56:51.720
Stuff.

Participant C 00:56:53.640 -- 00:57:01.960
Why do I think so. Because if I buy energy technology energy, efficiency technologies that help me to SA.

Participant C 00:57:04.560 -- 00:57:06.440
Promoted with this.

Participant C 00:57:08.360 -- 00:57:12.200
Website to tell me that. okay, if you buy.

Participant C 00:57:12.840 -- 00:57:17.960
If you use my product and you save a lot of energy, do you want to, but.

Participant C 00:57:18.680 -- 00:57:21.160
Customer already know their strategy.

Participant C 00:57:22.600 -- 00:57:39.080
For me, I would quickly check. Yeah, okay, and I, I would just want to check how good the products is efficient, and of course, I want to know how efficient this product fits to my own household of course, it's important.

Participant C 00:57:39.720 -- 00:57:40.360
So, so.

Miao, Yanwei 00:57:40.400 -- 00:57:48.680
So, so you think the website was created by some business people or like by some business brands?

Participant C 00:57:48.800 -- 00:57:51.240
I would say the website, it's more.

Participant C 00:57:53.880 -- 00:57:55.200
The product.

Miao, Yanwei 00:57:57.120 -- 00:58:06.600
This way, but actually if you, I saw you actually click on the, the new trans project.

Participant C 00:58:07.240 -- 00:58:08.520
Yeah, I did. That's why.

Miao, Yanwei 00:58:08.720 -- 00:58:14.800
And, and do you know the whole service was provided by Fraunhofer.

Miao, Yanwei 00:58:16.200 -- 00:58:21.320
And, you know, they are all research institutes, so there's no.

Participant C 00:58:21.360 -- 00:58:21.960
Money.

Miao, Yanwei 00:58:23.240 -- 00:58:26.400
Yes, like there are no companies that are involved.

Miao, Yanwei 00:58:27.760 -- 00:58:30.280
The Research Institute. So.

Miao, Yanwei 00:58:31.560 -- 00:58:39.240
Actually, no brands or no business. It's related to this project.

Participant C 00:58:39.600 -- 00:58:39.880
So.

Participant C 00:58:42.080 -- 00:58:46.800
It's more like the, the country is promoting.

Participant C 00:58:47.560 -- 00:58:50.760
Into a more greener place.

Participant C 00:58:51.520 -- 00:58:57.160
People to use gas or burn their calls anymore. Yeah, okay, so basically it's a good idea.

Participant C 00:59:01.680 -- 00:59:04.160
I think it's something.

Miao, Yanwei 00:59:06.120 -- 00:59:26.120
But, but that's in, that's very valuable. You're, you're inside there. So you think if it's, if it's by some business, then you think it's not just worthy, but if I tell you now they are research institutes and they are by the national German government and the EU.

Miao, Yanwei 00:59:26.600 -- 00:59:35.560
Do you still think it's, it's, it's not for promoting the products because they didn't even recommend you which brand to buy or which.

Miao, Yanwei 00:59:36.840 -- 00:59:45.000
Exactly which one to buy. They just say if you get a PV, you can back get the PV from any brands, anything anywhere.

Participant C 00:59:45.160 -- 00:59:46.280
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:59:47.160 -- 00:59:47.720
Trust voice.

Participant C 00:59:48.480 -- 01:00:01.160
Yeah, I would say my attitude would change a little bit from super skeptical to a little bit skeptical, then would test then I would test was my friend's house, which is super patty, an energy efficient.

Participant C 01:00:01.960 -- 01:00:05.000
And test it if they already did the passwork.

Participant C 01:00:05.640 -- 01:00:08.200
In, in this model still very bad, you know what I mean?

Participant C 01:00:08.840 -- 01:00:16.520
I want to know if this model in the end anyway, they will tell you that it's bad because if I already exert a very good parameters.

Participant C 01:00:17.200 -- 01:00:19.080
Like, highly energy efficient.

Participant C 01:00:21.360 -- 01:00:30.240
Tell me that you did a good job everything's, perfect, you don't need to buy the Sonar panels. I want to know this. I would test it in the model to see.

Participant C 01:00:31.240 -- 01:00:33.800
If I'm a super energy efficient.

Participant C 01:00:34.480 -- 01:00:42.120
They would say, Oh, now it's everything's good. You don't need any, any improvement if this is something like this in a model, I would trust it really a lot.

Miao, Yanwei 01:00:43.980 -- 01:00:49.100
You might just do, do the whole thing again.

Miao, Yanwei 01:00:49.860 -- 01:00:52.300
Beginning, and then you choose all the best option.

Participant C 01:00:56.900 -- 01:01:04.460
I want to see what, what would happen if I choose the best stop and then they still say, you have still have to buy a sort of panels.

Miao, Yanwei 01:01:06.380 -- 01:01:08.300
You can try it. Yes.

Participant C 01:01:08.340 -- 01:01:12.780
Okay, that's right. Another country I want to see if there's some difference.

Miao, Yanwei 01:01:13.060 -- 01:01:18.700
No, I, I only have touch land now. Sorry, but.

Miao, Yanwei 01:01:24.300 -- 01:01:29.300
I wonder like, why is your screen, Not showing those selections?

Participant C 01:01:30.060 -- 01:01:35.820
I don't know why it's okay when was the house built that me choose the most newest after.

Participant C 01:01:37.740 -- 01:01:44.500
Yes, how many people which one is the best.

Participant C 01:01:48.620 -- 01:01:54.380
So that you, oh, no, yeah, of course more is better because you share by more people or.

Miao, Yanwei 01:01:55.020 -- 01:01:56.940
Maybe I am not. So sure.

Participant C 01:01:57.020 -- 01:01:59.540
You have last week or you use last energy.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:00.980 -- 01:02:02.060
Could be.

Participant C 01:02:02.060 -- 01:02:02.700
But the energ...

Participant C 01:02:03.980 -- 01:02:06.540
It's talking about how many people per.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:06.540 -- 01:02:11.260
And it's for energy, I guess maybe more makes more sense. Yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:14.620 -- 01:02:16.780
Maybe he pump it's the best.

Participant C 01:02:16.780 -- 01:02:18.060
Okay, let's just keep.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:18.380 -- 01:02:18.700
Yeah.

Participant C 01:02:18.820 -- 01:02:19.980
Is it a hot water?

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:20.180 -- 01:02:22.460
Be having power tank.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:23.820 -- 01:02:33.540
Of course, a PV system, yes, no, you just said, yes, yes, and then choose the biggest one. The tank, you know what? yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:34.700 -- 01:02:40.460
And yes, a better system and a twenty kilow.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:43.260 -- 01:02:44.380
Yes.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:45.580 -- 01:02:47.620
And now you see.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:53.260 -- 01:02:57.740
Now you can still see your current energy bell, right?

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:58.380 -- 01:03:18.860
And then you will see the recommended configurations, which is it seems that your home energy system is already very technically economical and we do not have a recommendation that may lower energy future energy costs for you at the moment, but you can also see how different configurations.

Miao, Yanwei 01:03:18.900 -- 01:03:26.500
Will affect your house energy consumption by manually customizing your home energy system using our service.

Participant C 01:03:29.100 -- 01:03:31.020
So anyway they would tell me.

Miao, Yanwei 01:03:32.460 -- 01:03:34.340
Just give you whatever.

Participant C 01:03:38.700 -- 01:03:39.820
What.

Participant C 01:03:41.900 -- 01:03:44.460
Why is the energy bell, higher.

Miao, Yanwei 01:03:46.380 -- 01:03:48.940
Your current is the left one. You remember.

Participant C 01:03:50.260 -- 01:03:52.140
Why is the recommendation price higher?

Miao, Yanwei 01:03:52.780 -- 01:03:54.700
On the right one.

Miao, Yanwei 01:03:55.140 -- 01:03:59.460
Simulation if you go through, if you could scroll up.

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:01.100 -- 01:04:08.180
It's simulate, so you can just basically change everything the simulate to see what happened.

Participant C 01:04:12.820 -- 01:04:15.060
Can I change this simulate?

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:15.220 -- 01:04:20.300
You can change like, like here the simulation just give you a random thing.

Participant C 01:04:21.180 -- 01:04:22.540
I see.

Participant C 01:04:26.700 -- 01:04:31.140
Yeah, but I can change it. It's not from me.

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:31.460 -- 01:04:38.860
You remember the previous page already told you, like you can just go into check on whatever you want to see.

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:39.740 -- 01:04:42.020
No recommendation for you.

Participant C 01:04:42.700 -- 01:04:45.780
I see now I understand.

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:46.540 -- 01:04:47.660
Yes.

Participant C 01:04:48.460 -- 01:04:49.740
And it's just saying that's correct.

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:50.660 -- 01:04:51.780
Yes.

Participant C 01:04:52.740 -- 01:04:54.220
Nice, nice work.

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:55.500 -- 01:04:58.060
Now do you feel like you trusted a bit more.

Participant C 01:04:58.060 -- 01:04:58.700
Yeah, yeah.

Participant C 01:05:03.180 -- 01:05:04.460
At customer.

Miao, Yanwei 01:05:05.100 -- 01:05:24.940
No, you are good. You provide a lot of insights and, and okay, then I continue asking my questions. All right, are you considering investing in any of those recommended technologies? Like previously we have recommended some technolog.

Miao, Yanwei 01:05:25.220 -- 01:05:30.060
To you, would you consider investing them.

Participant C 01:05:30.060 -- 01:05:31.980
I have one questions regarding to your question.

Miao, Yanwei 01:05:32.100 -- 01:05:33.260
So, yes.

Participant C 01:05:33.900 -- 01:05:40.860
Investment means the money only to buy the technologies or including the installations.

Miao, Yanwei 01:05:42.860 -- 01:05:45.420
Investment means total.

Participant C 01:05:45.420 -- 01:05:46.700
Yeah, I understand.

Miao, Yanwei 01:05:49.900 -- 01:05:50.540
Would, would you like.

Miao, Yanwei 01:05:51.580 -- 01:05:59.500
Those technologies, if you see that they can actually have an impact on your energy Bill.

Participant C 01:06:00.140 -- 01:06:10.380
The government would pay would help me in certain present, if I try to save the, the whole world, buy my own money.

Participant C 01:06:11.220 -- 01:06:21.900
And I would think about it, but like, you know what I mean? If I buy a solar panel and then I can the government will pay at fifty percent for me. Not that much of me thirty percent.

Participant C 01:06:22.540 -- 01:06:25.100
I would really think about it.

Miao, Yanwei 01:06:25.100 -- 01:06:25.740
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 01:06:28.940 -- 01:06:30.860
All your, on your own.

Participant C 01:06:31.740 -- 01:06:37.900
Then I would still think about it, but not that like, really want to do it, like, still.

Participant C 01:06:39.180 -- 01:06:44.940
Because it really depends on how long I plan to live in this house.

Participant C 01:06:46.420 -- 01:06:50.700
If I am just a buyer of the house, for example, I buy this house.

Participant C 01:06:51.460 -- 01:06:51.980
Owner, but.

Participant C 01:06:55.180 -- 01:06:55.820
In two months.

Miao, Yanwei 01:06:55.860 -- 01:06:56.980
Okay.

Participant C 01:06:57.380 -- 01:07:01.580
Why do I have to do this investment? I didn't even get my money back and.

Miao, Yanwei 01:07:01.700 -- 01:07:11.420
Because you can sell it for more expensive price if you provide that your house, it's in the efficiency of level a.

Participant C 01:07:13.780 -- 01:07:16.940
Depends you have to calculate for me that.

Participant C 01:07:17.580 -- 01:07:20.780
Much much efficiency. I can really get the money.

Participant C 01:07:22.700 -- 01:07:23.820
But.

Miao, Yanwei 01:07:24.300 -- 01:07:28.060
Want to sell your house if you already bought this one.

Participant C 01:07:28.660 -- 01:07:37.420
I mean, if I change my working location, if I, I mean there's always something that I can switch my houses.

Participant C 01:07:38.260 -- 01:07:44.460
I sell it in this case, I would think about the investment, which is not fixed invest.

Participant C 01:07:46.260 -- 01:07:51.500
Means it's in a house, which, when I move off, it's, it belongs to the house.

Participant C 01:07:52.340 -- 01:08:03.020
All the recommendations from this MO model, it's fixed or fixed recommendations. It's not something like I do know in Taiwan when we.

Participant C 01:08:03.860 -- 01:08:05.580
On the AC, the air conditioner.

Participant C 01:08:06.940 -- 01:08:16.460
We can bring a lot of energy efficiency when you bring when you bought a certain kind of circulation fan a ventilatour.

Participant C 01:08:17.100 -- 01:08:18.380
And demonside.

Participant C 01:08:19.660 -- 01:08:29.900
Because if you buy this fan, it only costs two euros, Taiwanese dollars and it circulates the wind and cools the whole house down.

Participant C 01:08:30.700 -- 01:08:32.460
Using the same energy.

Participant C 01:08:33.740 -- 01:08:38.220
So if it's like this and I bought a fan and I move out, I can take it.

Participant C 01:08:38.220 -- 01:08:47.819
I would definitely do it like all the Tony's household. They do it, but the recommendation. now I got found this model is to really insert with such a high price.

Participant C 01:08:48.660 -- 01:08:49.740
I move out.

Participant C 01:08:50.380 -- 01:08:51.660
I don't even know. I can.

Participant C 01:08:51.940 -- 01:08:53.580
Solar panels with me.

Miao, Yanwei 01:08:53.700 -- 01:08:54.859
No, usually the.

Miao, Yanwei 01:08:55.580 -- 01:08:57.420
System they stay with the home. So.

Miao, Yanwei 01:08:59.339 -- 01:09:02.540
But yes, solar panels, You can actually bring with you.

Miao, Yanwei 01:09:03.180 -- 01:09:05.740
But it's just a lot of work.

Participant C 01:09:05.740 -- 01:09:25.580
I mean, oh, so in Germany that the installations causes very high. I think it's almost the same price as I bought. I don't know how much it cost, but in my imagination, it cost a lot. I bought this solo panels and also the installations of all the professional things...

Miao, Yanwei 01:09:26.299 -- 01:09:34.380
Makes sense, but what, if you don't want to move away, would you still invest in those technologies for your house?

Participant C 01:09:34.540 -- 01:09:39.660
Okay, it depends on my age. So if I'm going to, I'm like eighty years old. I'm going to die.

Participant C 01:09:40.980 -- 01:09:44.779
Why do I have to do this? Like, why, why?

Participant C 01:09:45.660 -- 01:09:47.339
My money in this, I'm already going to.

Miao, Yanwei 01:09:48.220 -- 01:09:58.500
Because for climate change, because for the environment, and because it actually can help you save energy bell, like, can help you save.

Miao, Yanwei 01:10:02.100 -- 01:10:02.700
Estimation.

Participant C 01:10:02.900 -- 01:10:09.740
Yeah, if I am forty years old, I will definitely be willing like, have enough money because I'm forty years old I have.

Participant C 01:10:10.460 -- 01:10:16.780
The investment I have my own host. Yeah, I would definitely do it, but if I'm like an old person, then it's.

Participant C 01:10:17.460 -- 01:10:33.420
It's still part of some, I wouldn't do it at all. So I think the focus group, the group that you focus, which would maybe very, very motivated is definitely not a students because they rent a house and they're definitely not a fresh man that just entered a society as working.

Participant C 01:10:35.340 -- 01:10:39.820
Someone who is in the middle of forty- two fifty and just retired got some money.

Participant C 01:10:40.460 -- 01:10:46.300
And if they are too old, they want, and also if you're just retired, you're thinking about.

Participant C 01:10:48.140 -- 01:10:51.340
And why are you making your house energy efficient?

Participant C 01:10:52.700 -- 01:10:54.540
Why like, why is the motive?

Miao, Yanwei 01:10:59.660 -- 01:11:16.940
You, you provide really good like perspective from this, from this like, angle, it's, it's really good. I really like it, and another question do you know why those recommendations were recommended to you?

Participant C 01:11:18.860 -- 01:11:30.980
Okay, because if there are five different ways of generating energy, there must be a best one which is more highly energy efficient.

Miao, Yanwei 01:11:32.340 -- 01:11:33.580
For your own situation?

Participant C 01:11:33.700 -- 01:11:37.900
Yeah, and the whole situation is based on the parameters, which I just insert.

Miao, Yanwei 01:11:38.060 -- 01:11:39.980
Okay, nice.

Participant C 01:11:39.980 -- 01:11:41.260
I have a question.

Participant C 01:11:42.060 -- 01:11:54.060
They didn't ask about my location more precisely regarding the landscape regarding the weather conditions regarding how big my whole apartment is.

Participant C 01:11:54.860 -- 01:12:03.020
Layer it is, because if I live on a third floor, like right now it's warmer and I need more cooling system for, if I have one.

Miao, Yanwei 01:12:03.780 -- 01:12:14.540
To answer the first question, your location question, we actually can provide very detailed, like, very just spot location.

Participant C 01:12:14.620 -- 01:12:15.740
Yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 01:12:16.540 -- 01:12:22.220
According to our model and the whole of Germany, it doesn't make a too big difference.

Participant C 01:12:22.220 -- 01:12:22.860
Oh, cool.

Participant C 01:12:23.500 -- 01:12:24.140
It's sup.

Miao, Yanwei 01:12:26.100 -- 01:12:31.180
But, you know, like, I know like many people want to know very precise detail.

Miao, Yanwei 01:12:32.620 -- 01:12:52.300
I could like, we could think of some ways, like some people might just want to do a quick scan so they can enter like some part of the, just they just need to enter Germany, but if you are very interested, knowing very, very detailed things we could even ask you like.

Miao, Yanwei 01:12:53.020 -- 01:13:11.500
Exactly and see again, you live and how many people there working habit is, are they working from home or are they working in the office and like those habits, how, what is your most comfortable temperature range?

Participant C 01:13:11.540 -- 01:13:13.420
Exactly, oh, I think.

Participant C 01:13:14.700 -- 01:13:17.900
The reason why it makes me a little bit untrust.

Participant C 01:13:19.260 -- 01:13:22.380
Also, because the, the question is something.

Participant C 01:13:23.660 -- 01:13:24.940
Close to my lifestyle.

Participant C 01:13:25.820 -- 01:13:29.420
Asking something about technologies equipment in my house.

Participant C 01:13:30.260 -- 01:13:47.980
Very far away from my life because I'm not an engineer, I'm a normal person. So this thing is more like you ask me what brand of fridge I bought which I don't care, but I care about if you're asking me my daily life habits, how often I show what temperatures make me feel comfortable.

Participant C 01:13:48.620 -- 01:13:57.580
I would feel like this is really personalized. So personalized feelings is like, this is more about me, but not only about the hardware and a house.

Participant C 01:13:58.500 -- 01:14:02.700
Person is also affecting how much energy consumption it is, right?

Miao, Yanwei 01:14:03.980 -- 01:14:11.020
But you think the, the final calculation was correct according to your current bill.

Participant C 01:14:11.020 -- 01:14:12.940
Yeah, that's surprisingly true.

Participant C 01:14:13.580 -- 01:14:18.700
I wasn't, I mean, I'm very critical and I want to see if it's true or not, and it's true.

Miao, Yanwei 01:14:19.980 -- 01:14:21.260
That's nice.

Miao, Yanwei 01:14:21.900 -- 01:14:25.740
I actually contribute to the, to your, to your trust a little bit.

Participant C 01:14:25.900 -- 01:14:27.020
Yeah, of course.

Miao, Yanwei 01:14:28.980 -- 01:14:36.620
So let me see. were you familiar with all those technologies before you use those systems?

Participant C 01:14:37.260 -- 01:14:45.580
No, because when I were doing a survey from this model, you have a lot of the descriptions and I think you, sa, you saw me.

Participant C 01:14:46.540 -- 01:14:52.620
Through everything a careful way, it doesn't mean that I, I want to do in a careful ways because I don't understand.

Miao, Yanwei 01:14:53.380 -- 01:15:00.940
So do you think after using the service you are more aware of what those technologies are actually for.

Participant C 01:15:01.100 -- 01:15:05.420
Yeah, I mean for awareness, of course, I, I aware it now.

Miao, Yanwei 01:15:05.420 -- 01:15:07.340
But more understanding.

Participant C 01:15:08.100 -- 01:15:09.900
Again, some understanding, yes, but.

Participant C 01:15:10.540 -- 01:15:12.460
If you test me right now. okay, what.

Participant C 01:15:13.740 -- 01:15:17.580
Something it means. I don't think I remember.

Miao, Yanwei 01:15:17.780 -- 01:15:24.620
Okay, but you can, if you don't remember what it means, you can always find the definition there.

Participant C 01:15:26.540 -- 01:15:33.580
So it's not something that I can immediately learn as knowledge, but it's something that I have something in my mind so.

Participant C 01:15:33.700 -- 01:15:34.220
I have.

Miao, Yanwei 01:15:35.060 -- 01:15:44.220
So do you, do you think like, overall you would say that you, your knowledge of those technologies improved a little bit after using it.

Participant C 01:15:44.700 -- 01:15:52.780
On a scale of one to ten of improvement, I would say is like one, two, four, like, not like one to ten, like.

Participant C 01:15:53.420 -- 01:15:54.700
For a lot.

Participant C 01:15:55.420 -- 01:16:09.420
Give me some time to look through like a Google myself, what technology it is. I really, I think this is like a base that motivates me to learn more about those energy efficiency tech.

Miao, Yanwei 01:16:09.420 -- 01:16:10.700
Technologies, yes.

Participant C 01:16:11.340 -- 01:16:19.020
But I really like that they didn't really explain me so much that make me feel annoyed, but it's like a intro.

Participant C 01:16:20.300 -- 01:16:22.860
Yeah, I brought understanding.

Miao, Yanwei 01:16:22.860 -- 01:16:26.500
So you think it's a good way doing this way.

Participant C 01:16:32.020 -- 01:16:35.020
Always want them to provide me some.

Participant C 01:16:36.940 -- 01:16:47.180
About reliable ones, because if I could go by myself, how do I know the information I, I check is, is correct and if you are based on an institute that do the research.

Participant C 01:16:47.220 -- 01:16:49.100
Exactly on this area.

Participant C 01:16:51.060 -- 01:16:59.340
Give me a, some links and videos which easier for me to learn more information if I really want to know what exactly this technology is about and.

Participant C 01:17:00.340 -- 01:17:08.940
Think about wow okay, This is really a nice cool technology and why don't I buy it and use it? It's good that you just only give me one.

Participant C 01:17:09.820 -- 01:17:12.780
General understanding of what that means, but.

Participant C 01:17:12.980 -- 01:17:14.700
Only helps me to do the survey.

Miao, Yanwei 01:17:14.820 -- 01:17:15.980
But it doesn't.

Participant C 01:17:15.980 -- 01:17:25.060
Help me to have a deeper understanding of the technology and also give me the motivation to really.

Participant C 01:17:26.380 -- 01:17:28.140
Fascinating and want to buy it.

Participant C 01:17:28.780 -- 01:17:39.020
The motions and I would say if you are doing a customer journey doing this process when I go through the prototype, then motions is very.

Participant C 01:17:40.380 -- 01:17:44.780
There's not really like a wow. Okay, so cool, like there.

Participant C 01:17:45.540 -- 01:17:46.700
Up and downs.

Participant C 01:17:47.340 -- 01:17:53.740
Annoyed or angry. No, but it's very flat and, and neutral if that's, what you want.

Miao, Yanwei 01:17:54.380 -- 01:18:01.420
Yes, actually, actually, that's partly like, because that's our, not our main focus.

Miao, Yanwei 01:18:02.740 -- 01:18:05.900
Do you remember when you first saw the PV.

Miao, Yanwei 01:18:06.740 -- 01:18:21.900
Green Bar and they actually exceed your demand remember, so isn't you feel surprised like, wow, actually the PV generated electricity. It's more than what I need.

Participant C 01:18:21.940 -- 01:18:22.540
I.

Participant C 01:18:23.340 -- 01:18:41.740
At that time I wasn't happy about it. I was just thinking about if it's like, I need money for eating and you give me more money than I need, and I would think why like, I don't need that much, so it's like you give me more energy, but I don't need that much. I, I, this is my life. This is my lifestyle.

Participant C 01:18:42.500 -- 01:18:44.940
This, isn't comfort for me. You give me more.

Participant C 01:18:45.580 -- 01:18:48.780
For, for what I.

Participant C 01:18:50.060 -- 01:18:55.820
I won't feel like, wow, it's so nice. I have more, I mean, it's energy, it's not money, It's, it's like...

Miao, Yanwei 01:18:56.580 -- 01:19:09.900
Maybe one thing I, I didn't, maybe if you don't know, it's, if you have a PV and if you generate more energy than you actually need.

Miao, Yanwei 01:19:11.220 -- 01:19:15.020
Yes, the electricity goes back to the grid.

Participant C 01:19:16.340 -- 01:19:17.460
Minus.

Miao, Yanwei 01:19:17.980 -- 01:19:19.500
You got minus user.

Participant C 01:19:19.700 -- 01:19:22.060
So in Taiwan, it's forbidden.

Participant C 01:19:23.340 -- 01:19:26.540
It's forbidden because you can pay less.

Miao, Yanwei 01:19:26.540 -- 01:19:36.780
Yes, that's, that's in Germany, it's the case that's why you pay less because these months you probably spend minus two hundred Euro for yours.

Participant C 01:19:37.460 -- 01:19:43.820
Exactly, I know this, I know this because in Taiwan, a lot of people put solar panels.

Participant C 01:19:44.660 -- 01:19:47.020
They got minus bills from the government.

Miao, Yanwei 01:19:47.660 -- 01:19:48.300
Yes.

Participant C 01:19:48.300 -- 01:19:49.580
Government's very angry.

Miao, Yanwei 01:19:50.220 -- 01:19:52.140
Really that's weird.

Participant C 01:19:52.140 -- 01:19:53.420
We're right, because.

Participant C 01:19:53.620 -- 01:20:03.660
Legal to put to insert and install. There are other panels on your own. You have to ask the government for permission and stuff. It's anyway, it's about.

Miao, Yanwei 01:20:03.660 -- 01:20:05.580
That's a different culture.

Miao, Yanwei 01:20:06.220 -- 01:20:19.020
Yes, but now do you feel more comfortable that, actually if you, they provide more, like, if PV generates more electricity and it actually gets your money, they use.

Participant C 01:20:20.940 -- 01:20:22.580
I'm happy.

Miao, Yanwei 01:20:22.860 -- 01:20:23.500
Okay...

Participant C 01:20:23.780 -- 01:20:31.180
I would like to know the extent like you, you said you said I can get some money back if it's like one or two cents.

Participant C 01:20:31.820 -- 01:20:36.940
And I really didn't see the difference if it's one, one or two hundred euros a month, then I see the difference.

Miao, Yanwei 01:20:37.620 -- 01:20:53.580
If you look at that table right now, you can see, like, for example, June or yeah, April, it's fine and the, the PV generates more than double of what your demand.

Miao, Yanwei 01:20:55.220 -- 01:21:04.180
So in the whole month, you, let's say if in June, you need to pay two hundred for your energy bill.

Miao, Yanwei 01:21:04.860 -- 01:21:14.100
That means you actually get minus four hundred Euro back. You get four hundred euro back.

Miao, Yanwei 01:21:16.340 -- 01:21:17.460
So.

Miao, Yanwei 01:21:19.660 -- 01:21:28.060
You definitely earn. That's why your energy bill like in the end was so low, it's only nine hundred for the whole year.

Miao, Yanwei 01:21:29.140 -- 01:21:30.420
Yes, yes, that's.

Participant C 01:21:30.540 -- 01:21:39.380
Satisfied, then I'm happy to, maybe I think after your explanations make me more motivated to install this technology.

Participant C 01:21:42.580 -- 01:21:47.700
I, I think I can save some money and also save the world and why not.

Miao, Yanwei 01:21:47.900 -- 01:21:59.860
Yes, yes, like the, the whole service was for making people realizing that actually you save a lot of money and you save the planet.

Miao, Yanwei 01:22:01.220 -- 01:22:17.140
But, but maybe we should provide more information to make you realize that it's, it's really hoping. Yeah, and I think it's also because like, for example, you, you're your background, it's a bit different, like in Taiwan, they, they can't just simply.

Miao, Yanwei 01:22:19.300 -- 01:22:24.820
So you probably have a different mindset of thinking of those extra energies.

Miao, Yanwei 01:22:25.780 -- 01:22:35.700
The Germans that I interviewed, they would quickly realize. Well, I can actually get that money back, so there's also some cultural background.

Miao, Yanwei 01:22:36.620 -- 01:22:38.260
Was doing something there.

Miao, Yanwei 01:22:38.900 -- 01:22:47.860
Yes, yes, but, but it's really really nice, to get those insights. So now do you believe in adopting those Techn.

Miao, Yanwei 01:22:49.780 -- 01:22:51.060
Energy cost.

Miao, Yanwei 01:22:54.260 -- 01:23:03.100
Yes, and those are all my questions for you. I'm so thankful that you spend so much time with me. One more hour.

Participant C 01:23:03.260 -- 01:23:03.860
Congratulation.

Miao, Yanwei 01:23:04.580 -- 01:23:14.700
Thank you so much. and it's really a lot of insights. I'm so grateful. All right, so happy that you admit it to, to come.

Miao, Yanwei 01:23:15.380 -- 01:23:17.860
Do you have any extra?

Miao, Yanwei 01:23:19.220 -- 01:23:28.060
Questions or thoughts or concerns regarding the whole interview or the system.

Participant C 01:23:30.460 -- 01:23:40.980
Because I think it's very interesting that you also consider that the Germans cares about data security and all the thing I insert is nothing critical.

Miao, Yanwei 01:23:42.940 -- 01:23:44.860
Yes, we did.

Participant C 01:23:46.380 -- 01:23:49.940
So something which I don't care about, but I think Germans care, so it's good.

Miao, Yanwei 01:23:53.780 -- 01:24:03.380

Have you ever considered implementing energy efficient technologies such as solo panel or smart demo steps.

gudrun Willner 00:06:24.740 -- 00:06:29.220
Yes, we have a solar panel.

gudrun Willner 00:06:30.100 -- 00:06:31.140
For hot water.

Miao, Yanwei 00:06:31.180 -- 00:06:32.300
Okay.

gudrun Willner 00:06:34.980 -- 00:06:51.620
We thought about photovoltaics, but it's not feasible, at our house. We have not got a free space on the roof sufficiently, right side.

Miao, Yanwei 00:06:52.260 -- 00:06:52.900
All right.

gudrun Willner 00:06:53.580 -- 00:07:03.660
The neighbor gives shadow is too close and, or the position of our house is in.

gudrun Willner 00:07:07.100 -- 00:07:10.020
In between the, the major.

gudrun Willner 00:07:14.020 -- 00:07:15.900

gudrun Willner 00:07:32.740 -- 00:07:33.860
Not good.

gudrun Willner 00:07:34.740 -- 00:07:41.020
But we are thinking if it is easier just for transportable.

gudrun Willner 00:07:44.020 -- 00:07:49.860
If it, we could arrange at another place, but on the roof.

gudrun Willner 00:07:50.740 -- 00:07:53.660
We have not got enough place.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:54.140 -- 00:07:56.900
Was it because you already had a solar panel.

gudrun Willner 00:07:57.540 -- 00:08:01.500
Yes, yes, because when we changed our.

gudrun Willner 00:08:03.420 -- 00:08:18.660
Heating Central heating uses this because it is one machinery that works together what water and TT.

gudrun Willner 00:08:19.300 -- 00:08:32.780
Yes, yes, so it was for us the best decision for, for our host. It was something like six or something years ago. Yeah, it is seven. It is seven years ago. Yes.

gudrun Willner 00:08:34.300 -- 00:08:52.580
Yeah, and at the moment, it's still, I mean it's still working and working Well, so at the moment we are not thinking to change and so as soon as it breaks down, so we will change to a renewable heating.

Miao, Yanwei 00:08:52.580 -- 00:08:53.700
Okay.

gudrun Willner 00:08:55.940 -- 00:08:57.700
Gives us during the summer.

gudrun Willner 00:08:58.540 -- 00:09:13.580
Hot water without using gas only if there is a, some two weeks of, of bed weather, then gas works, but normally during the summer, we don't need it.

gudrun Willner 00:09:15.620 -- 00:09:18.580
I'm cooking, I'm cooking with gas as well.

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:20.180 -- 00:09:22.620

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:28.140 -- 00:09:33.620
What is your understanding regarding the benefits of energy efficient technologies?

gudrun Willner 00:09:36.100 -- 00:09:41.380
Yes, we, we want to use more.

gudrun Willner 00:09:43.780 -- 00:10:02.980
Like, like Solar or if it would be possible for wind, but for private person, it is not possible because anything of wind, for example, yes. and using the heat of the earth, it is so.

gudrun Willner 00:10:04.340 -- 00:10:24.820
It's yeah, too expensive for our little house. Yeah, but, but the heat pump would be feasible, but, but as soon as our heating one spreaks down, we will change. yes, when, when we change.

gudrun Willner 00:10:25.460 -- 00:10:36.340
There was no discussion of no more using gas and so we didn't think of another possibility. That was this cheap gas from Russia.

Miao, Yanwei 00:10:39.620 -- 00:10:44.260
You want to change it and why, why do you want to change them?

gudrun Willner 00:10:47.220 -- 00:10:52.340
Well, we, we don't want to buy the guest for, from Russia.

gudrun Willner 00:10:52.980 -- 00:11:01.300
And we think we have to do more from, or against the climate change.

gudrun Willner 00:11:03.220 -- 00:11:10.260
We tried to use less energy during the winter and we did, yes.

gudrun Willner 00:11:12.220 -- 00:11:15.380
We've tried to save energy. That's what we're.

Miao, Yanwei 00:11:16.660 -- 00:11:28.820
So, so the most reasons for you are to reduce the reliability or was Russia or was an energy was climate change.

gudrun Willner 00:11:29.020 -- 00:11:29.460
Yes.

gudrun Willner 00:11:30.140 -- 00:11:37.780
Change the most important thing is, is that we have to do more for the, against the climate change.

Miao, Yanwei 00:11:37.780 -- 00:11:40.340
Because of the financial aspect.

gudrun Willner 00:11:41.620 -- 00:11:55.700

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:15.880 -- 00:26:16.840
Okay, no worries.

gudrun Willner 00:28:32.520 -- 00:28:33.160
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:28:34.160 -- 00:28:34.440
Okay.

gudrun Willner 00:28:34.600 -- 00:28:36.360
Yes, you've got it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:28:38.280 -- 00:28:40.200
It's similar or.

gudrun Willner 00:28:42.760 -- 00:28:45.960
Page in the time.

Miao, Yanwei 00:28:47.280 -- 00:28:48.520
For the whole year.

gudrun Willner 00:28:48.520 -- 00:28:55.560
Of the merely here it's yes.

gudrun Willner 00:28:57.480 -- 00:29:01.600
It's weird for electricity.

gudrun Willner 00:29:02.600 -- 00:29:07.720
Four hundred and twenty- one use.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:07.720 -- 00:29:08.840
Okay.

gudrun Willner 00:29:18.600 -- 00:29:23.080
Thousand four hundred, forty- eight euros.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:23.840 -- 00:29:24.360
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:28.200 -- 00:29:30.760
And so better. Yes.

gudrun Willner 00:29:30.760 -- 00:29:33.440
And then then we got a.

gudrun Willner 00:29:36.000 -- 00:29:40.360
From, from the, from the state.

gudrun Willner 00:29:43.800 -- 00:29:44.920
Energy.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:45.480 -- 00:29:46.600
Okay.

gudrun Willner 00:29:48.040 -- 00:29:49.320
A little bit. Yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:49.360 -- 00:29:55.320
So you, you actually use a bit less than two, two thousand.

gudrun Willner 00:29:58.920 -- 00:30:08.520
It was, yes, it was the year where some months we had really a very expensive guess.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:09.960 -- 00:30:11.880
Yes, that, that to you.

gudrun Willner 00:30:12.200 -- 00:30:15.720
Not yes, now it is lower.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:15.760 -- 00:30:17.640
So, yeah.

gudrun Willner 00:30:17.960 -- 00:30:21.120
In former times, it was, it was less.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:21.480 -- 00:30:22.600
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:24.160 -- 00:30:29.160
What do you think? it's also because of the solar panel that you had during.

gudrun Willner 00:30:29.360 -- 00:30:31.080
It was the son appendant.

gudrun Willner 00:30:32.480 -- 00:30:36.200
It reduced it very good.

gudrun Willner 00:30:39.600 -- 00:30:43.880
Could see it in, in the, in the last years.

gudrun Willner 00:30:54.120 -- 00:30:57.600
Yes, I, I just can.

gudrun Willner 00:31:01.160 -- 00:31:02.920
If one number doesn't.

gudrun Willner 00:31:05.680 -- 00:31:07.760
That's what I have done.

gudrun Willner 00:31:10.120 -- 00:31:11.240
Yes.

gudrun Willner 00:31:15.560 -- 00:31:16.680
Yes.

gudrun Willner 00:31:21.720 -- 00:31:23.720
Kilowatts don't.

gudrun Willner 00:31:24.840 -- 00:31:25.960
Yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:31:27.400 -- 00:31:28.040
So do you think.

Miao, Yanwei 00:31:28.800 -- 00:31:30.120
The estimation.

gudrun Willner 00:31:32.840 -- 00:31:40.720
To yours, it's about two thousand three. No, yes, two thousand, four hundred.

gudrun Willner 00:31:42.760 -- 00:31:49.160
You know what our less gas or with the, with the solar panel.

Miao, Yanwei 00:31:49.800 -- 00:31:53.640
Okay, that's really nice to.

Miao, Yanwei 00:31:55.560 -- 00:31:56.680
And.

gudrun Willner 00:32:04.640 -- 00:32:08.120
Let's see anything guy, This is so guys.

Miao, Yanwei 00:32:12.840 -- 00:32:26.360
So do you, do you think the system like this service it, the, the estimated cost if it's to your real cost.

Miao, Yanwei 00:32:28.200 -- 00:32:29.480
Your actual cost.

gudrun Willner 00:32:30.400 -- 00:32:33.960
External cost, yes, they are. Okay. I think yes.

gudrun Willner 00:32:36.600 -- 00:32:41.120
We would like to use photo type, but.

gudrun Willner 00:32:45.480 -- 00:32:48.680
The most expensive really is the heating.

gudrun Willner 00:32:49.320 -- 00:32:51.960
And, and we.

gudrun Willner 00:32:56.360 -- 00:33:01.480
The energy from green Planet. Do you know, green planet.

gudrun Willner 00:33:02.280 -- 00:33:03.400
Mean, peace.

Miao, Yanwei 00:33:03.400 -- 00:33:05.320
It's a company or.

gudrun Willner 00:33:05.520 -- 00:33:10.480
From green piece. Yes, it's a company. They use.

gudrun Willner 00:33:13.000 -- 00:33:14.120
Wintcars.

gudrun Willner 00:33:15.560 -- 00:33:16.680
And.

gudrun Willner 00:33:22.880 -- 00:33:27.800
Wind and solar in a electricity and.

gudrun Willner 00:33:29.720 -- 00:33:34.200
And they always tell us if we.

gudrun Willner 00:33:40.520 -- 00:33:43.640
Got you, if you come consume.

gudrun Willner 00:33:46.360 -- 00:33:53.440
How much for our house and the house is not. So, so big.

gudrun Willner 00:33:54.600 -- 00:33:58.920
But for, for us, it's always.

gudrun Willner 00:34:01.000 -- 00:34:11.639
It's always a very slow amount. So we are, we, are, we are very good in, in, in.

gudrun Willner 00:34:13.560 -- 00:34:14.440
Saving energy.

Miao, Yanwei 00:34:14.600 -- 00:34:15.720
Saving.

gudrun Willner 00:34:15.720 -- 00:34:17.000
It says yes...

Miao, Yanwei 00:34:17.639 -- 00:34:18.280
That's good...

Miao, Yanwei 00:34:20.960 -- 00:34:22.080
And.

Miao, Yanwei 00:34:23.440 -- 00:34:32.240
If you look at this interface of the service, you could see several, like spokes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:34:33.639 -- 00:34:40.679
Right, like cards and the left one. it's the current.

Miao, Yanwei 00:34:41.960 -- 00:34:47.080
Situation, yes, and then on the right hand side, those.

Miao, Yanwei 00:34:48.520 -- 00:34:52.679
They are the recommendations for your home.

Miao, Yanwei 00:34:54.760 -- 00:35:10.760
Three options for your home, like, not, not really three options, but like they recommended you three options from the most cost-benefit one, and there's also the lowest energy bell one.

gudrun Willner 00:35:11.400 -- 00:35:12.040
Yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:12.040 -- 00:35:17.000
And also the lowest investment recommendation.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:19.080 -- 00:35:39.560
Yeah, so it just meant like those are the recommendation for your house, if you think one of it is, it sounds good. Like it sounds exciting, you can see, like, check.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:39.760 -- 00:35:46.720
Details or those configurations for your house energy technologies.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:49.960 -- 00:35:55.560
For example, the first card it says you can save save six.

gudrun Willner 00:35:56.680 -- 00:35:58.120
Yes, yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:58.760 -- 00:36:03.880
And the second one it can help you save one thousand four hundred.

Miao, Yanwei 00:36:05.200 -- 00:36:14.120
So these are the recommend recommended configurations so that it can help you save this much of money.

gudrun Willner 00:36:16.040 -- 00:36:16.680
Yes, yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:36:17.960 -- 00:36:21.160
Does it make sense now or for those.

gudrun Willner 00:36:22.480 -- 00:36:27.560
Understand it okay. Yeah, but as we say, we, we all considered this.

gudrun Willner 00:36:28.280 -- 00:36:30.120
It's not feasible. That's a moment.

Miao, Yanwei 00:36:30.480 -- 00:36:31.400
Yes.

gudrun Willner 00:36:32.240 -- 00:36:32.680
Change to.

gudrun Willner 00:36:33.320 -- 00:36:34.600
Pump system that's.

gudrun Willner 00:36:35.880 -- 00:36:41.000
We, we have a relatively new heating, so.

Miao, Yanwei 00:36:41.760 -- 00:36:42.920
You don't wanna change. So.

gudrun Willner 00:36:44.200 -- 00:36:46.120
What we are doing, try to save simply.

Miao, Yanwei 00:36:46.800 -- 00:36:48.680
Yes, I understand.

gudrun Willner 00:36:48.680 -- 00:36:54.440
So, and as soon as the, the heating gets old or breaks down, so we will change.

gudrun Willner 00:36:55.560 -- 00:37:03.280
Think of changing of course to, to heat pump or something like this? Yes, and for the renovation of the building.

gudrun Willner 00:37:07.920 -- 00:37:10.440
We have, yeah, it's not.

gudrun Willner 00:37:11.760 -- 00:37:18.760
Quite a good isolation system. We had to change, for example, our roof.

gudrun Willner 00:37:20.400 -- 00:37:22.440
A better, either isolation.

gudrun Willner 00:37:24.080 -- 00:37:28.000
But from the outside, it's not possible.

gudrun Willner 00:37:30.920 -- 00:37:32.920
Because we have.

gudrun Willner 00:37:35.160 -- 00:37:47.240
What is it? We have a special brick on a mental bricks in front of the house or.

gudrun Willner 00:37:48.240 -- 00:37:51.400
Between, between the, the walls.

gudrun Willner 00:37:54.600 -- 00:38:04.200
And the, the only bricks there is a isolation isolation, but of course it is an isolation...

gudrun Willner 00:38:04.880 -- 00:38:08.720
Which was necessary in the year of.

gudrun Willner 00:38:10.600 -- 00:38:12.520
Ninety- ninety- eight.

gudrun Willner 00:38:15.080 -- 00:38:18.920
Yeah, better, but it's not, so yeah.

gudrun Willner 00:38:23.040 -- 00:38:24.680
Much more better.

gudrun Willner 00:38:24.680 -- 00:38:27.240
Twenty- five years later, of course.

gudrun Willner 00:38:27.880 -- 00:38:31.040
And yeah.

gudrun Willner 00:38:31.720 -- 00:38:34.280
Also easy, it's not easy to, to change.

Miao, Yanwei 00:38:36.840 -- 00:38:45.800
Yeah, like these are only recommendations. You don't, you don't have to really follow them. They just like, provide an.

Miao, Yanwei 00:38:48.600 -- 00:38:54.120
So you can also click the more detail this button.

gudrun Willner 00:38:54.120 -- 00:38:56.680
Yes, more detail button.

gudrun Willner 00:38:57.080 -- 00:38:58.880
What does it say?

Miao, Yanwei 00:38:59.880 -- 00:39:08.080
Supposed to show you the, the actual estimates with those, with the configuration.

Miao, Yanwei 00:39:09.480 -- 00:39:12.040
If you look at the left side, it's the...

Miao, Yanwei 00:39:13.960 -- 00:39:34.440
Right side, it's the simulate, which is the one you just clicked the, the recommendation you just click clicked and these are the estimates of how much energy demand like how much energy will be demanded, if you use the.

Miao, Yanwei 00:39:34.560 -- 00:39:43.640
Recommendation you just clicked and on the left side, it's the, your current situation though, how it was.

Miao, Yanwei 00:39:46.600 -- 00:39:47.240
Does it make Sen?

Miao, Yanwei 00:39:48.520 -- 00:39:49.160
I.

gudrun Willner 00:39:54.400 -- 00:40:00.040
It would look different, for example, for hot water, we.

gudrun Willner 00:40:01.960 -- 00:40:02.600
During summer.

Miao, Yanwei 00:40:06.440 -- 00:40:07.080
That's.

gudrun Willner 00:40:07.720 -- 00:40:10.920
Where there will be more difference. I think.

Miao, Yanwei 00:40:15.680 -- 00:40:24.680
Like you have some, some more more unique situation that the whole model didn't actually consider that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:40:26.440 -- 00:40:42.520
But yeah, so this is like a similar detailed explanation of how this configuration actually will be looking.

gudrun Willner 00:40:43.720 -- 00:40:45.600
Which means PV.

Miao, Yanwei 00:40:47.600 -- 00:40:49.480
Photo photo.

gudrun Willner 00:40:51.840 -- 00:40:53.960
Oh yeah, yes. yes.

gudrun Willner 00:40:55.280 -- 00:40:59.720
Yes, yes, well this would be interesting for us.

gudrun Willner 00:41:00.600 -- 00:41:09.960
Only if we can use pv panels, we could put them on other sides of our roof.

gudrun Willner 00:41:11.240 -- 00:41:11.880
Yes, yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:41:12.520 -- 00:41:15.920
You also mentioned, I, I guess so.

Miao, Yanwei 00:41:17.640 -- 00:41:20.840
But yeah, like from here you can see like.

Miao, Yanwei 00:41:21.680 -- 00:41:29.160
Have a water, then the photo, what type can generate generate a five.

Miao, Yanwei 00:41:29.160 -- 00:41:30.440
Kilowatts when you.

Miao, Yanwei 00:41:31.400 -- 00:41:32.960
The whole year.

Miao, Yanwei 00:41:38.120 -- 00:41:39.240
So.

Miao, Yanwei 00:41:40.680 -- 00:41:45.960
Yeah, I think basically, you have already seen all the pages.

Miao, Yanwei 00:41:47.720 -- 00:41:54.760
There is one more boxes down there. There's a green line or green G.

gudrun Willner 00:41:55.600 -- 00:41:56.680
Yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:41:56.680 -- 00:42:04.960
Yes, yes, but this is for like, introduce you some information regarding climate change.

Miao, Yanwei 00:42:08.240 -- 00:42:08.840
Yes, but.

Miao, Yanwei 00:42:09.840 -- 00:42:12.680
Very general, some information...

gudrun Willner 00:42:14.400 -- 00:42:17.160
Okay, okay, yes, we, well.

gudrun Willner 00:42:17.160 -- 00:42:20.360
Yes, yes, we know about this. Yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:42:22.280 -- 00:42:32.520
You were aware and you also like conducted like you your energy consumption behavior is also very green. According.

Miao, Yanwei 00:42:34.040 -- 00:42:35.840
Yeah, the comp.

Miao, Yanwei 00:42:37.640 -- 00:42:40.840
So these are just some, like, extra information.

Miao, Yanwei 00:42:42.120 -- 00:42:43.400
For the service.

Miao, Yanwei 00:42:44.800 -- 00:42:52.120
You can read if, if, if, you know, like, most of the things it's also fine.

gudrun Willner 00:42:52.360 -- 00:42:53.000
Okay.

gudrun Willner 00:42:54.280 -- 00:42:54.920
As we know about.

gudrun Willner 00:42:56.440 -- 00:42:58.440
So, for example.

gudrun Willner 00:43:00.680 -- 00:43:03.880
Yes, we, you can, from the time.

gudrun Willner 00:43:04.640 -- 00:43:08.360
Having a shower, the most easy thing.

gudrun Willner 00:43:09.640 -- 00:43:10.760
And.

gudrun Willner 00:43:12.200 -- 00:43:15.400
Collect rain water collect rainwater or.

gudrun Willner 00:43:16.920 -- 00:43:20.680
We have three hundred liters and.

gudrun Willner 00:43:23.080 -- 00:43:25.640
And I, I use this for the garden.

gudrun Willner 00:43:27.560 -- 00:43:36.520
This year, I up to now I did not use drinking water for the garden.

gudrun Willner 00:43:36.720 -- 00:43:40.360
We are composing. I'm composting yes.

gudrun Willner 00:43:41.640 -- 00:43:42.760
Positive.

gudrun Willner 00:43:46.760 -- 00:43:51.200
Yes, for reducing waste.

gudrun Willner 00:43:52.920 -- 00:43:58.280
We choose a green energy provider for the green. Of course.

gudrun Willner 00:43:58.280 -- 00:44:02.040
Reducing reducing waste. I.

gudrun Willner 00:44:04.800 -- 00:44:18.760
I try to buy minimal packaging, for example, the, the, of course I drink water from yes, our drinking water.

gudrun Willner 00:44:20.800 -- 00:44:27.080
I reduce, I, I use bags different times, for example.

gudrun Willner 00:44:34.760 -- 00:44:36.040
What else...

Miao, Yanwei 00:44:37.960 -- 00:44:39.840
Not too many years.

gudrun Willner 00:44:41.600 -- 00:44:45.640
I'm not sure we wrote for political leaders who.

gudrun Willner 00:44:50.160 -- 00:44:51.680
The Green Party.

gudrun Willner 00:44:55.880 -- 00:45:00.360
And we try to use the car.

gudrun Willner 00:45:03.560 -- 00:45:13.080
Yeah, not, so often not often, Yeah, so we have the possibility to work, so doing our shopping.

gudrun Willner 00:45:15.080 -- 00:45:17.000
And if it is not too much.

gudrun Willner 00:45:17.640 -- 00:45:20.200
We go, I think, yes.

gudrun Willner 00:45:22.760 -- 00:45:23.880
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:45:26.080 -- 00:45:30.440
Do you mind go back to the previous page again.

Miao, Yanwei 00:45:31.840 -- 00:45:32.360
Google.

Miao, Yanwei 00:45:35.560 -- 00:45:36.840
And yes, I can.

gudrun Willner 00:45:43.280 -- 00:45:51.560
So I use the other one if you have, we want to save more with a better way system or.

Miao, Yanwei 00:45:51.760 -- 00:45:52.840
It's okay...

gudrun Willner 00:45:52.840 -- 00:45:55.640
Yes, I opened this. Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:45:59.240 -- 00:46:01.160
So if you look at the right.

Miao, Yanwei 00:46:02.160 -- 00:46:05.640
That your energy bell for the whole year will be only five.

gudrun Willner 00:46:07.880 -- 00:46:08.200
Yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:46:09.480 -- 00:46:12.720

S- s- e, M- S.

Miao, Yanwei 00:46:15.880 -- 00:46:19.080
It's smart energy Management system.

Miao, Yanwei 00:46:21.840 -- 00:46:24.200
It's like a, a small software.

gudrun Willner 00:46:24.200 -- 00:46:26.760
That can go to software for a smart home.

Miao, Yanwei 00:46:27.080 -- 00:46:28.040
Yes, yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:46:28.680 -- 00:46:29.320
Exactly.

gudrun Willner 00:46:29.320 -- 00:46:33.800
Oh, yes, there. I don't know anything.

gudrun Willner 00:46:35.080 -- 00:46:38.280
No, no, we don't don't know how to use this.

Miao, Yanwei 00:46:39.080 -- 00:46:42.760
It's, I think you don't need to, like know.

Miao, Yanwei 00:46:43.560 -- 00:46:45.960
Use it, but itself. Can.

gudrun Willner 00:46:45.960 -- 00:46:46.600
Yes.

gudrun Willner 00:46:51.120 -- 00:46:53.640
When we changed our heating.

gudrun Willner 00:46:54.280 -- 00:46:56.080
We had.

gudrun Willner 00:46:58.120 -- 00:47:07.000
Few more firm company, a company with Yeah, Ecologic.

gudrun Willner 00:47:10.920 -- 00:47:20.840
So they said this will cost how much it costs for us and how much can we can we.

gudrun Willner 00:47:22.480 -- 00:47:25.640
How, how they can can use it in our house.

gudrun Willner 00:47:26.920 -- 00:47:36.520
They tried to optimize all these heating in the rooms for our house.

gudrun Willner 00:47:37.840 -- 00:47:41.640
Hit a look just of this building.

gudrun Willner 00:47:42.320 -- 00:47:45.560
To optimize how to do it and.

gudrun Willner 00:47:46.760 -- 00:48:03.400
Yes, and when I asked after we had the solar panels, is it possible now to use Photol types, they said they haven't got space and they can use, they can just plan for one or two.

Miao, Yanwei 00:48:08.520 -- 00:48:10.440
Okay, so the.

Miao, Yanwei 00:48:11.080 -- 00:48:14.280
What was the heating system? They, they mentioned.

gudrun Willner 00:48:14.440 -- 00:48:20.400
Yes, they mentioned the heating system and, and the together with a- with this order.

Miao, Yanwei 00:48:20.680 -- 00:48:21.320
Okay...

Miao, Yanwei 00:48:23.880 -- 00:48:27.080
The personalized ones are usually more.

Miao, Yanwei 00:48:28.360 -- 00:48:30.280
On your real situation.

gudrun Willner 00:48:32.000 -- 00:48:41.680
Very good information. The look for yes, how large are the rules and with.

gudrun Willner 00:48:45.640 -- 00:48:49.480
For, for the cubic meters. Oh yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:48:52.040 -- 00:48:53.960
Yeah, I believe so.

gudrun Willner 00:48:54.600 -- 00:49:02.920
And for electricity saving, okay, we, we changed the light we use LED.

Miao, Yanwei 00:49:03.560 -- 00:49:04.200
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:49:06.120 -- 00:49:16.360
That's nice. Okay. All right, I think, I think you've already navigated through the whole service. The online web service.

Miao, Yanwei 00:49:17.640 -- 00:49:24.040
Now it's already been almost, it's almost fifty- five minutes. So it's.

Miao, Yanwei 00:49:25.960 -- 00:49:42.600
The length of the, the interviews that I thought would be if you want to cancel, like, if you want to cancel and now it's also, okay, but if you still have time.

gudrun Willner 00:49:43.120 -- 00:49:44.520
Yeah, we still got time.

gudrun Willner 00:49:46.440 -- 00:49:47.080
Yes, yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:49:47.720 -- 00:49:52.200
I do have more questions like, more regarding to like after you.

gudrun Willner 00:49:52.240 -- 00:49:54.760
So I, I go back to the.

Miao, Yanwei 00:49:56.680 -- 00:49:57.320
You can.

gudrun Willner 00:49:59.920 -- 00:50:01.400
Change, yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:50:03.720 -- 00:50:05.000
The Webex.

Miao, Yanwei 00:50:18.840 -- 00:50:19.960
I.

gudrun Willner 00:50:23.560 -- 00:50:24.680
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:50:29.080 -- 00:50:33.560
I'm also note sure, maybe maybe the left.

gudrun Willner 00:50:34.840 -- 00:50:36.520
Do I have to stop.

Miao, Yanwei 00:50:38.880 -- 00:50:48.280
It's also fine, if we just have this screen here and I, I can just directly ask the questions if you.

gudrun Willner 00:50:49.600 -- 00:50:58.000
That's not, that's if I just put in. Yeah, sure.

Miao, Yanwei 00:51:01.080 -- 00:51:04.200
Yes, I guess could be.

Miao, Yanwei 00:52:30.680 -- 00:52:33.200
How do you feel about those recommendations?

gudrun Willner 00:52:33.880 -- 00:52:36.440
It's a good idea. It's a good idea.

gudrun Willner 00:52:37.120 -- 00:52:43.480
Yes, but we, we have gone through all this considering our energy situation. Yeah.

gudrun Willner 00:52:44.240 -- 00:52:51.800
For example, was it firm. That's recommended how to, to optimize our house.

gudrun Willner 00:52:53.280 -- 00:53:02.680
Was some years ago when we changed the heating, yes, seven years. Unfortunately, we, we couldn't get photo world tag.

gudrun Willner 00:53:04.640 -- 00:53:11.000
Our heating system is gas at the moment. So, or the installed guests.

gudrun Willner 00:53:12.520 -- 00:53:18.680
So that was a different situation. So five, five or six years ago. So yeah.

gudrun Willner 00:53:18.720 -- 00:53:24.120
Seven years it was seven years, it was seven years ago, seven years and we can, we can.

gudrun Willner 00:53:25.200 -- 00:53:31.480
With our solar panel, we were safe quite a lot already. Yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:53:31.520 -- 00:53:32.760
Yes, yes, that's.

gudrun Willner 00:53:33.760 -- 00:53:38.520
And the better. Yeah, downsheating than the former gasting.

gudrun Willner 00:53:39.160 -- 00:53:44.920
We can see that we save twenty percent of ener.

gudrun Willner 00:53:45.800 -- 00:53:48.120
After changing yes.

gudrun Willner 00:53:50.960 -- 00:53:53.240
We wanted to.

gudrun Willner 00:53:54.600 -- 00:54:00.280
Save more energy and I can look yes, and we did it, yes, we did it.

gudrun Willner 00:54:00.920 -- 00:54:03.480
We use less gas.

gudrun Willner 00:54:05.440 -- 00:54:06.560
Before.

Miao, Yanwei 00:54:06.720 -- 00:54:08.600
It's because of your.

gudrun Willner 00:54:08.600 -- 00:54:09.240
Yes.

gudrun Willner 00:54:11.800 -- 00:54:15.000
We changed the temperature for the room.

gudrun Willner 00:54:15.640 -- 00:54:22.040
Yes, yes, and without feeling that it is too cold.

gudrun Willner 00:54:23.320 -- 00:54:25.240
We use pullovers. Yes, we use Pullo.

gudrun Willner 00:54:28.440 -- 00:54:30.360
Change even more.

Miao, Yanwei 00:54:32.280 -- 00:54:52.760
That's really nice and do you mind if I ask whether the, you, you said you have asked the assessment guide to came to your home to check on this and give you personalized recommendations. Do you think those recommendations are similar to the recommendation?

Miao, Yanwei 00:54:52.960 -- 00:54:55.040
Service gave you.

gudrun Willner 00:54:56.600 -- 00:54:59.280
Yes, yes, of course they are thinking.

gudrun Willner 00:55:01.080 -- 00:55:06.120
Another way, for example, they told us, of course, you can.

gudrun Willner 00:55:08.120 -- 00:55:19.640
This, and that for saving energy using green energy and, but they, of course, they tell you how much it will cost to.

gudrun Willner 00:55:20.280 -- 00:55:31.800
And so you have to consider if it is worth for you for changing, if, if you know that it will take you so many years.

gudrun Willner 00:55:32.560 -- 00:55:33.720
Forgetting the money.

gudrun Willner 00:55:35.720 -- 00:55:38.200
Depends on your financial situation.

gudrun Willner 00:55:38.840 -- 00:55:41.520
So some, some.

gudrun Willner 00:55:43.320 -- 00:55:48.360
Energy saving is maybe ecological.

Miao, Yanwei 00:55:48.720 -- 00:55:49.080
But.

gudrun Willner 00:55:52.920 -- 00:56:05.080
Economic economic, yes, economic. So, if you have lots of money, you can say, Oh, no, in any case I want to be more ecological, so I, I spent my money.

gudrun Willner 00:56:06.560 -- 00:56:16.600
If you're have a shorter budget, so you choose the most economic in, in the current situation. So.

Miao, Yanwei 00:56:17.880 -- 00:56:23.640
I don't know if you have noticed in the service. The recommendation card.

Miao, Yanwei 00:56:25.720 -- 00:56:27.480
Investment, yes.

gudrun Willner 00:56:28.120 -- 00:56:35.800
Yes, of course. Yes, but which it, it doesn't tell you how much it will cost.

gudrun Willner 00:56:35.920 -- 00:56:48.600
Changing if you use this. So for example, we know if it is possible, we would choose photo role tigh because we can pay it.

gudrun Willner 00:56:49.360 -- 00:56:51.160
We got the money for this.

gudrun Willner 00:56:57.560 -- 00:56:58.840
We don't know how to manage it.

gudrun Willner 00:57:00.120 -- 00:57:13.800
And so if you, for example, you have to pay fifteen thousand euros for something like this, and, you know, I will.

gudrun Willner 00:57:17.640 -- 00:57:24.440
Thousand five hundred per year, you know, in ten years you got the money back.

gudrun Willner 00:57:26.360 -- 00:57:29.560
So this is what they tell you as well.

Miao, Yanwei 00:57:30.840 -- 00:57:40.440
That's nice and do you find the recommendations are useful or valuable like in our service.

gudrun Willner 00:57:44.920 -- 00:57:46.200
Yes, yes.

gudrun Willner 00:57:46.880 -- 00:57:48.760
It's okay, yeah, yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:57:48.760 -- 00:57:50.680
Okay, if you think it doesn't.

Miao, Yanwei 00:57:51.680 -- 00:57:55.880
Really good. All right, and are you.

Miao, Yanwei 00:57:57.200 -- 00:58:09.240
I think you told me already the factors that influence your decision to adopt or reject the recommendations. I think you already told me that, so let's keep that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:58:11.800 -- 00:58:16.000
And do you know why the recommendations were recommended to you.

Miao, Yanwei 00:58:20.120 -- 00:58:21.400
In the service.

gudrun Willner 00:58:26.680 -- 00:58:27.800
Don't understand the.

Miao, Yanwei 00:58:29.720 -- 00:58:46.760
I do it again. Do you think do you know why those recommendations were recommended to you? like, why not some other recommendations, but there were only those three recommendations recommended to you.

gudrun Willner 00:58:50.880 -- 00:58:54.280
The most important recommendations I don't know.

Miao, Yanwei 00:58:55.320 -- 00:58:59.800
It's also fine, if you don't know, like, why they were recommended.

Miao, Yanwei 00:59:05.560 -- 00:59:26.680
It's, it's normal like you just say whether you think the recommendation will recommend it because the system already knew, what's your house condition was, so they found you those recommendations or you don't you'd have no idea how they actually came up with.

Miao, Yanwei 00:59:26.960 -- 00:59:40.920
Those recommendations, or they could also be like the recommendations were just recommended to everyone. You could also think that way, but if.

Miao, Yanwei 00:59:42.200 -- 00:59:45.440
Think the recommendations was actually.

Miao, Yanwei 00:59:46.560 -- 00:59:56.240
Based on your input at the beginning or do you think the recommendation will, will be recommended to everyone who's using the service?

gudrun Willner 00:59:59.960 -- 01:00:03.000
Here's your query, use it for everyone.

Miao, Yanwei 01:00:04.440 -- 01:00:05.720
And you think it could be.

Miao, Yanwei 01:00:09.040 -- 01:00:11.040
All right, then.

Miao, Yanwei 01:00:13.600 -- 01:00:16.160
Do you trust the recommendations.

Miao, Yanwei 01:00:20.060 -- 01:00:23.260
And why, why do you trust it?

gudrun Willner 01:00:25.820 -- 01:00:28.980
I mean, your, your representing.

gudrun Willner 01:00:31.020 -- 01:00:34.140
A trustable organization.

gudrun Willner 01:00:36.700 -- 01:00:38.620
That's important, I mean, yeah, yes.

Miao, Yanwei 01:00:41.820 -- 01:00:50.900
And so what other factors contributed to their trust or lack of trust, you think.

Miao, Yanwei 01:00:52.700 -- 01:00:54.500
Trusted organization.

Miao, Yanwei 01:00:57.180 -- 01:01:11.820
Is, do you think it's also because the recommendations were similar to what's the assessment people who came they provided similar recommendations to you.

gudrun Willner 01:01:11.940 -- 01:01:15.380
I mean, the firm when they came, they.

gudrun Willner 01:01:17.300 -- 01:01:20.860
They looked very closely at our house. So.

gudrun Willner 01:01:22.820 -- 01:01:29.820
Calculation including the actual dimension of the House of the, of the rooms and, and so on.

gudrun Willner 01:01:32.460 -- 01:01:34.300
They were closer at our object.

Miao, Yanwei 01:01:34.940 -- 01:01:36.220
So you would trust.

gudrun Willner 01:01:38.260 -- 01:01:38.780
Within.

gudrun Willner 01:01:39.420 -- 01:01:44.540
You, you cannot do do this. What, what I did. So.

gudrun Willner 01:01:45.820 -- 01:01:49.660
Yes, I think you have to see the house.

gudrun Willner 01:01:51.580 -- 01:01:56.700
So, for example, we have a small ground.

gudrun Willner 01:01:57.980 -- 01:01:59.100
To.

gudrun Willner 01:02:01.180 -- 01:02:05.660
No, no, two floors. Yes.

gudrun Willner 01:02:06.300 -- 01:02:11.260
If you have a bungalow, which has a great.

gudrun Willner 01:02:13.340 -- 01:02:17.180
Square meters and, and just just one flow...

gudrun Willner 01:02:17.820 -- 01:02:24.220
For example, we have a neighbor. So one side we don't lose so much eating.

gudrun Willner 01:02:25.500 -- 01:02:26.780
There is the needle.

gudrun Willner 01:02:27.740 -- 01:02:29.340
The site we do.

gudrun Willner 01:02:30.820 -- 01:02:33.820
But our neighbor is in the middle, so we are three houses.

gudrun Willner 01:02:36.380 -- 01:02:40.860
He will use less than we will do with the site.

gudrun Willner 01:02:41.500 -- 01:02:43.940
You have to see the building.

Miao, Yanwei 01:02:44.860 -- 01:02:45.980
Makes sense, yes.

gudrun Willner 01:02:46.620 -- 01:02:48.860
And you have.

gudrun Willner 01:02:50.500 -- 01:02:57.060
To see the roof as well. Can you, can you.

gudrun Willner 01:02:58.380 -- 01:02:59.940
Do more.

Miao, Yanwei 01:03:01.380 -- 01:03:02.500
Installation.

gudrun Willner 01:03:03.260 -- 01:03:07.100
Yes, isolation, yes. Isolation on the roof.

gudrun Willner 01:03:07.260 -- 01:03:10.300
For example, friends of us.

gudrun Willner 01:03:12.860 -- 01:03:23.220
Their house is a little bit older than ours and they plan a total new goof just for isolation from above...

Miao, Yanwei 01:03:23.740 -- 01:03:24.860
Okay.

gudrun Willner 01:03:26.980 -- 01:03:35.460
And for Elder wholes, it is m- even more important because they have nearly no, risolation.

gudrun Willner 01:03:42.940 -- 01:03:47.420
So, yes, I think it is important to, to see.

gudrun Willner 01:03:48.700 -- 01:03:57.020
And then to think where can we do more for saving energy?

Miao, Yanwei 01:03:57.780 -- 01:03:58.300
So.

gudrun Willner 01:03:59.580 -- 01:04:09.820
For example, our, our neighbors, which are living in, in west, in the middle of these three houses they changed last year, they are hitting.

gudrun Willner 01:04:10.100 -- 01:04:12.380
But again, guess.

gudrun Willner 01:04:13.860 -- 01:04:20.700
They still hot head. The, the first heating, which was planned when we, when we built thousand.

gudrun Willner 01:04:20.700 -- 01:04:32.860
And I asked did your think of an electric pump? Yeah, yeah, electric pump. is it okay...

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:33.220 -- 01:04:33.500
Come.

gudrun Willner 01:04:34.860 -- 01:04:42.460
Of it, but it is not possible because you need three meters of distance to the neighbor.

gudrun Willner 01:04:43.740 -- 01:04:48.860
Our houses have six meters. So.

gudrun Willner 01:04:49.500 -- 01:04:50.780
Three meters to.

gudrun Willner 01:04:51.020 -- 01:04:52.060
Three meters, three, other.

gudrun Willner 01:04:52.900 -- 01:04:54.620
There's no space.

gudrun Willner 01:04:55.980 -- 01:04:56.540
Pump.

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:57.180 -- 01:04:57.820
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 01:04:59.220 -- 01:04:59.740
So.

gudrun Willner 01:05:00.140 -- 01:05:18.660
The best thing would be for our three houses. We buy one for three houses, but then you have to have a very good contact to all neighbors, and yes, I think.

gudrun Willner 01:05:19.780 -- 01:05:25.340
Neighbor is, I think not much interesting it's not so much interesting in this.

Miao, Yanwei 01:05:27.260 -- 01:05:30.460
Okay, but it's good that I, I also.

gudrun Willner 01:05:32.020 -- 01:05:35.580
It's the wrong way that each house has.

gudrun Willner 01:05:36.900 -- 01:05:52.220
Only it's own system. It would be safe even more energy if you make for, I think six, seven thousand houses or ten houses together.

gudrun Willner 01:05:53.620 -- 01:05:57.700
You can use the energy from the Earth from.

Miao, Yanwei 01:05:57.980 -- 01:05:58.620
Yeah, yeah.

gudrun Willner 01:05:59.260 -- 01:06:00.540
Which would be even better.

gudrun Willner 01:06:01.820 -- 01:06:05.660
Than this electric pumps, but it cost.

gudrun Willner 01:06:06.340 -- 01:06:09.860
Something like fifty thousand euros. I, I.

gudrun Willner 01:06:13.340 -- 01:06:16.100
Know a person they did it.

gudrun Willner 01:06:17.180 -- 01:06:22.300
Yes, before, before all this discussion was because they just got the money.

Miao, Yanwei 01:06:24.220 -- 01:06:31.260
And that actually helped them save like, did they save enough money to.

gudrun Willner 01:06:31.260 -- 01:06:32.540
Yes, they do.

gudrun Willner 01:06:35.300 -- 01:06:38.300
At first you heads to help these fifty thousand.

Miao, Yanwei 01:06:41.500 -- 01:06:51.140
That's really a lot. All right, so next question. Were you familiar with those technologies before using this system?

gudrun Willner 01:06:57.500 -- 01:07:03.940
No, I hate to, when we.

gudrun Willner 01:07:07.780 -- 01:07:12.220
You think when we change our heating system, if we know it before.

Miao, Yanwei 01:07:12.500 -- 01:07:16.060
I mean, before using the website, I just sent.

Miao, Yanwei 01:07:17.980 -- 01:07:19.900
You, you are already familiar with.

gudrun Willner 01:07:20.140 -- 01:07:23.740
Those techniques, yes, yes, we are familiar office. Yeah, yes.

Miao, Yanwei 01:07:23.940 -- 01:07:31.420
But I remember that you asked me what is SEMS? So like the smart Energy Management.

gudrun Willner 01:07:33.420 -- 01:07:34.620
I did not know. Yes.

Miao, Yanwei 01:07:34.700 -- 01:07:36.540
Okay, so just this one, and then the.

Miao, Yanwei 01:07:39.980 -- 01:07:41.100
So.

Miao, Yanwei 01:07:44.220 -- 01:07:53.180
I guess did you think the system has provided enough information for you to understand those technologies. The.

gudrun Willner 01:07:55.780 -- 01:07:58.540
Understandable, well, this is.

gudrun Willner 01:08:01.500 -- 01:08:04.060
I, I still don't know how it works.

Miao, Yanwei 01:08:04.060 -- 01:08:05.340
You mean the, which.

gudrun Willner 01:08:07.380 -- 01:08:08.540
Smart SM.

gudrun Willner 01:08:10.460 -- 01:08:13.020
I don't know how it works.

Miao, Yanwei 01:08:13.020 -- 01:08:16.180
But, you know what it is now.

gudrun Willner 01:08:18.580 -- 01:08:20.060
Not really no, not.

Miao, Yanwei 01:08:23.980 -- 01:08:30.940
Do you, if you click the button actually of the smart energy management system, if you.

gudrun Willner 01:08:32.220 -- 01:08:34.779
Yes, in the other thing moment.

Miao, Yanwei 01:08:35.460 -- 01:08:40.740
And there should be a small introduction of this technology.

gudrun Willner 01:08:45.020 -- 01:08:49.020
Yes, I go here. No, it, it does.

gudrun Willner 01:08:51.420 -- 01:08:57.940
So you can see Guysia, here's smart and daughter.

gudrun Willner 01:09:04.420 -- 01:09:07.339
System to minimize.

gudrun Willner 01:09:12.580 -- 01:09:16.380
How does it work? I, I still don't understand how it.

gudrun Willner 01:09:17.700 -- 01:09:20.980
Okay, so you can buy it.

gudrun Willner 01:09:22.620 -- 01:09:23.740
How.

Miao, Yanwei 01:09:24.140 -- 01:09:26.540
You can buy this technology.

Miao, Yanwei 01:09:27.900 -- 01:09:41.339
This technology has the feature of, of what the, what it says on, on the website, but it didn't introduce you enough information. You probably still don't know how that actually.

gudrun Willner 01:09:41.540 -- 01:09:43.900
No, I don't, I don't know how to.

Miao, Yanwei 01:09:44.900 -- 01:09:45.180
Yeah.

gudrun Willner 01:09:45.460 -- 01:09:47.740
Install it how to use it.

Miao, Yanwei 01:09:47.900 -- 01:09:52.220
Yes, yeah, all right, Like it doesn't really provide that much.

Miao, Yanwei 01:09:54.780 -- 01:09:56.060
It's okay, but, but.

gudrun Willner 01:09:56.380 -- 01:09:57.980
I think for this, I would.

gudrun Willner 01:09:58.620 -- 01:10:01.820
Ask for a company.

gudrun Willner 01:10:02.460 -- 01:10:13.380
Yes, yes, a company. if they can help us to understand this or for example, each year we.

gudrun Willner 01:10:16.060 -- 01:10:23.580
Have a cleaning from the heating systems and we do this by the company, which installed it in our house.

gudrun Willner 01:10:24.420 -- 01:10:26.340
So I would ask.

gudrun Willner 01:10:26.980 -- 01:10:33.340
If they know how can we use it? I think it is a new thing you.

gudrun Willner 01:10:34.700 -- 01:10:37.220
Didn't have it seven years ago.

gudrun Willner 01:10:37.900 -- 01:10:58.340
I think it's quite new. So, but they are very interesting in interested in, in, in use an ecologic energy, so they, they know, and they, they don't.

gudrun Willner 01:10:58.420 -- 01:11:04.740
Work for any producer or fitting systems, for example, so.

gudrun Willner 01:11:05.700 -- 01:11:17.540
Looked at our house and said, Well, for you, we would give you this heating system from this, produced from this company, for example.

Miao, Yanwei 01:11:18.940 -- 01:11:23.300
Yeah, but now, you know, like there is a technology like.

gudrun Willner 01:11:24.220 -- 01:11:27.140
Okay, so I would ask them.

Miao, Yanwei 01:11:27.380 -- 01:11:27.780
You could.

gudrun Willner 01:11:29.940 -- 01:11:37.380
As they could explain us how it is working and I think they could in install it.

Miao, Yanwei 01:11:38.020 -- 01:11:41.860
Maybe, but I'm just like, guessing.

Miao, Yanwei 01:11:43.780 -- 01:11:45.980
Okay, and.

Miao, Yanwei 01:11:47.620 -- 01:11:52.580
Let me see what other. I think you answered many questions already.

Miao, Yanwei 01:11:54.020 -- 01:12:01.900
So has your knowledge of energy efficient technologies improved as a result of using the service.

Miao, Yanwei 01:12:04.260 -- 01:12:09.300
Do you think you now know a bit more of those technologies.

Miao, Yanwei 01:12:12.180 -- 01:12:13.220
They're using the websit...

gudrun Willner 01:12:14.500 -- 01:12:16.900
For the technology.

Miao, Yanwei 01:12:17.740 -- 01:12:18.980
You don't, thank you.

gudrun Willner 01:12:19.060 -- 01:12:25.980
No, no, not for the technology just for the opinion, which.

gudrun Willner 01:12:27.940 -- 01:12:30.340
Yeah, you can combine.

gudrun Willner 01:12:33.580 -- 01:12:35.620
For saving energy.

Miao, Yanwei 01:12:35.660 -- 01:12:45.740
Okay, so yeah, that's also like, you can say part of knowledge you, okay, and.

gudrun Willner 01:12:46.500 -- 01:12:50.660
If you want to know how it is working, you have.

gudrun Willner 01:12:52.540 -- 01:12:56.740
More information about the techniques, the.

Miao, Yanwei 01:12:56.780 -- 01:12:57.380
Techniques.

Miao, Yanwei 01:12:58.660 -- 01:13:03.140
And I think all the questions being asked.

gudrun Willner 01:13:03.460 -- 01:13:04.420
Okay, yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 01:13:04.780 -- 01:13:10.820
Have any additional questions or any thoughts or concerns regarding.

gudrun Willner 01:13:11.460 -- 01:13:17.220
In what discipline are you doing your master thesis?

Miao, Yanwei 01:13:17.860 -- 01:13:19.780
In human computer interaction.

gudrun Willner 01:13:20.420 -- 01:13:21.540
Oh.

Miao, Yanwei 01:13:22.540 -- 01:13:24.260
It's a very new subject...

Miao, Yanwei 01:13:27.460 -- 01:13:28.740
At Seagan.

gudrun Willner 01:13:28.740 -- 01:13:29.380
Yeah, yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 01:13:32.060 -- 01:13:33.860
Any more questions.

Miao, Yanwei 01:13:34.660 -- 01:13:35.140
Want to know.

Miao, Yanwei 01:13:36.740 -- 01:13:37.700
Human computer.

gudrun Willner 01:13:41.540 -- 01:13:43.460
So, yes, good luck.

gudrun Willner 01:13:44.460 -- 01:13:48.580
Do you need more people for your.

gudrun Willner 01:13:52.660 -- 01:13:56.260
Can recommend, well, we can ask friends of us.

gudrun Willner 01:13:57.540 -- 01:14:01.380
They would do it as well. I got your contacts.

gudrun Willner 01:14:02.020 -- 01:14:09.700
So if someone says, yes, we will do it as well. I can send you the contact.

Miao, Yanwei 01:14:09.860 -- 01:14:10.980
That would be great, thank you.

Miao, Yanwei 00:00:04.100 -- 00:00:09.820 \\
I start with the demographical questions.

Miao, Yanwei 00:00:11.660 -- 00:00:15.660 \\
I would like to know your gender and your age.

Participant F 00:00:16.740 -- 00:00:18.660 \\
Male and I'm twenty- nine.

Miao, Yanwei 00:00:18.700 -- 00:00:25.820 \\
Oh, hey, and your educational background, like what major are you were you studying?

Participant F 00:00:26.340 -- 00:00:30.180 \\
I have a master in Mechanical Engineering.

Miao, Yanwei 00:00:32.099 -- 00:00:35.380 \\
Okay, and your current occupation.

Participant F 00:00:37.380 -- 00:00:39.140 \\
But to all Vienna.

Miao, Yanwei 00:00:39.140 -- 00:00:39.780 \\
Okay.

Participant F 00:00:41.180 -- 00:00:42.300 \\
Student.

Miao, Yanwei 00:00:43.780 -- 00:00:46.060 \\
And your nationality.

Miao, Yanwei 00:00:49.500 -- 00:00:53.740 \\
Do you have any knowledge or interesting artificial intelligence?

Participant F 00:00:55.780 -- 00:01:00.900 \\
Yes, I have little knowledge and I have high interest, let's say.

Miao, Yanwei 00:01:01.540 -- 00:01:07.940 \\
Okay, and what about your knowledge and interesting energy domain?

Participant F 00:01:07.980 -- 00:01:09.220 \\
And energy.

Participant F 00:01:09.860 -- 00:01:14.340 \\
I interest in, I would say, higher knowledge. Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:01:15.500 -- 00:01:24.580 \\
And have you heard of, of energy efficient appliances or renewable energy technologies for households?

Miao, Yanwei 00:01:27.140 -- 00:01:38.020 \\
And have you ever considered implementing energy and efficient technologies such as social panels or solar panels or smart thermostat.

Participant F 00:01:39.940 -- 00:01:53.380 \\
Considered, yes, but I'm living in a shared you say, not in a house where we have many parties, so it's impossible to install permission for everyone. Yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:01:55.940 -- 00:02:04.860 \\
When you are doing the service, would you like to consider that the situation of your families house or.

Participant F 00:02:06.820 -- 00:02:10.020 \\
In my family, my parents, they are.

Participant F 00:02:10.860 -- 00:02:14.420 \\
They're looking to install PV.

Participant F 00:02:15.300 -- 00:02:25.340 \\
I don't live with them anymore. I live in an apartment and there, it's not possible to install anything because I would have to get the agreement of every.

Participant F 00:02:28.580 -- 00:02:31.780 \\
Every apartment owner and south kinds of.

Miao, Yanwei 00:02:31.780 -- 00:02:35.860 \\
Okay, so it's because it's someone else's house.

Participant F 00:02:36.660 -- 00:02:44.580 \\
Basically, yes, and no. So the house is the house belongs to partly everyone who owns an apartment.

Miao, Yanwei 00:02:44.580 -- 00:02:45.700 \\
Okay.

Participant F 00:02:46.700 -- 00:02:50.980 \\
If you want to do something on the roof or on the walls, you have to get the agreement of every.

Miao, Yanwei 00:02:53.540 -- 00:02:58.580 \\
Okay, so it's an apartment like I shared Vicky.

Participant F 00:03:00.580 -- 00:03:02.500 \\
Yeah, no, it's just an apartment.

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:02.500 -- 00:03:03.140 \\
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:05.060 -- 00:03:14.620 \\
All right, that's continue. and what is your understanding regarding the benefits of energy efficient technologies.

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:16.580 -- 00:03:17.220 \\
Yes.

Participant F 00:03:17.860 -- 00:03:19.140 \\
And you are.

Participant F 00:03:21.260 -- 00:03:22.340 \\
Demands.

Participant F 00:03:23.100 -- 00:03:29.340 \\
Which comes with cost production and you have a lower environmental impact.

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:29.380 -- 00:03:38.980 \\
Yeah, and do you know about climate change and why is it important for individual to save energy?

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:44.100 -- 00:03:47.940 \\
So you've done with all the pre- question.

Participant F 00:03:47.940 -- 00:03:48.580 \\
Perfect.

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:51.300 -- 00:03:55.620 \\
I would like to send you a link via the chat.

Miao, Yanwei 00:03:56.260 -- 00:03:57.780 \\
One moment.

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:01.380 -- 00:04:19.299 \\
Because the, the model is actually for single family house. so I'm not sure which house situation you are supposed to use. Maybe you can use your current living house, but then.

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:19.340 -- 00:04:22.500 \\
You need to consider the whole building's environment.

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:23.260 -- 00:04:32.100 \\
You can also consider whether it's your parents' house then, and you can just use the parameters for your parents house.

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:34.660 -- 00:04:35.940 \\
So do you.

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:36.140 -- 00:04:37.220 \\
The link.

Participant F 00:04:38.500 -- 00:04:41.060 \\
I cannot show my screen or should I share my screen?

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:41.340 -- 00:04:44.180 \\
That would be nice if you can share your screen.

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:51.940 -- 00:04:53.060 \\
Yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:04:55.180 -- 00:05:10.500 \\
Yes, now I can see. So now you can start and eh, during, during the testing session you can ask whatever questions you have, or you can think aloud if you.

Miao, Yanwei 00:05:11.140 -- 00:05:13.620 \\
Yes, yes, go ahead.

Participant F 00:05:15.140 -- 00:05:16.900 \\
You tried the tools are enough.

Miao, Yanwei 00:05:16.900 -- 00:05:17.540 \\
Oh, really.

Participant F 00:05:21.060 -- 00:05:22.660 \\
Been sent me the, the link.

Miao, Yanwei 00:05:22.660 -- 00:05:23.780 \\
Okay.

Participant F 00:05:26.500 -- 00:05:28.420 \\
I'll do it for my parents host and.

Miao, Yanwei 00:05:28.420 -- 00:05:30.860 \\
Okay, perfect.

Participant F 00:05:37.380 -- 00:05:39.940 \\
Currently less than four seven year.

Participant F 00:05:54.660 -- 00:05:56.100 \\
It's very smart.

Participant F 00:06:01.060 -- 00:06:06.180 \\
Okay, now we see the current attributes estimated P- two thousand, seven fifty, seven.

Participant F 00:06:08.100 -- 00:06:18.180 \\
Actually, it would be cool to compare this to the, actually, I could ask parents if it's about around it, but I think it's fairly accurate.

Miao, Yanwei 00:06:18.980 -- 00:06:22.820 \\
Why, why do you think it's fairly accurate? Oh, that's.

Participant F 00:06:22.820 -- 00:06:25.500 \\
No, I think it's because.

Participant F 00:06:27.300 -- 00:06:29.860 \\
I think it makes sense. Somehow.

Participant F 00:06:32.900 -- 00:06:33.700 \\
Using currently.

Participant F 00:06:34.980 -- 00:06:36.300 \\
But, but.

Participant F 00:06:38.820 -- 00:06:40.740 \\
Should be in a good range.

Participant F 00:06:45.220 -- 00:06:46.500 \\
For those investment.

Participant F 00:06:51.700 -- 00:06:54.180 \\
You save six hundred us per year.

Participant F 00:06:56.100 -- 00:06:57.900 \\
But this.

Participant F 00:06:59.380 -- 00:07:05.100 \\
Annual last investment cost is six hundred seventy six, so it would be still.

Participant F 00:07:06.980 -- 00:07:10.180 \\
And negative cost benefit, right?

Participant F 00:07:11.460 -- 00:07:12.580 \\
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:12.940 -- 00:07:31.900 \\
Here here, because we use like three different methods to calculate, like the choose the recommendation and one of the method it's through the most cost benefit, which is the one that saved the most.

Participant F 00:07:32.780 -- 00:07:37.700 \\
The highest which the highest cost divided by savings ratio.

Miao, Yanwei 00:07:38.100 -- 00:07:53.020 \\
Yes, but sometimes there is still like the bug, like, for example, now, so it's still, it's not really cost benefit because it's the investment money is actually more than the savings, but.

Participant F 00:07:54.060 -- 00:08:05.860 \\
But this is low, and I think what would be really nice if we could implement co- two cost as co- two reduction potential, but that's not implemented in a model yet.

Miao, Yanwei 00:08:05.860 -- 00:08:07.780 \\
Do you mean by a share two.

Participant F 00:08:08.420 -- 00:08:09.060 \\
Co- two.

Miao, Yanwei 00:08:09.060 -- 00:08:10.340 \\
Ah, okay, failed.

Participant F 00:08:10.500 -- 00:08:12.260 \\
Come carbon emission. So.

Participant F 00:08:13.980 -- 00:08:18.660 \\
We save that many carbon emissions, but I know that we haven't implemented it in the model if.

Miao, Yanwei 00:08:19.940 -- 00:08:21.860 \\
And it's nice. I suggestion.

Participant F 00:08:23.780 -- 00:08:32.099 \\
Especially when you switch from a gas boiler to maybe a, is it here a PV change to where he comes system? Yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:08:34.020 -- 00:08:41.500 \\
So you can, you understand the, the recommendation page? Well, do you think you can understand it.

Participant F 00:08:42.380 -- 00:08:43.620 \\
This one kind of week.

Participant F 00:08:46.180 -- 00:08:47.980 \\
Understand that you have.

Miao, Yanwei 00:08:49.380 -- 00:08:51.300 \\
Okay, great.

Miao, Yanwei 00:08:56.420 -- 00:08:57.540 \\
Perfect.

Participant F 00:09:02.820 -- 00:09:03.940 \\
Yeah.

Participant F 00:09:04.780 -- 00:09:06.020 \\
Click on this. I have.

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:06.700 -- 00:09:07.300 \\
My current.

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:07.980 -- 00:09:11.020 \\
Why do you choose the second recommendation?

Participant F 00:09:11.780 -- 00:09:13.700 \\
Just to see the difference.

Participant F 00:09:16.380 -- 00:09:18.820 \\
I just wanted to see what, what's, what's behind it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:18.820 -- 00:09:19.460 \\
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:21.380 -- 00:09:23.740 \\
It's all right. That's good.

Participant F 00:09:25.220 -- 00:09:29.140 \\
Current, is this a comparison current tool?

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:30.340 -- 00:09:35.460 \\
Current simulate the, the recommendation that you chose.

Participant F 00:09:37.020 -- 00:09:38.020 \\
Current, no.

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:38.780 -- 00:09:39.300 \\
This is your.

Participant F 00:09:41.220 -- 00:09:47.900 \\
Is there also the current compared to... No, this is the PV production, right? And this is.

Miao, Yanwei 00:09:50.820 -- 00:09:51.940 \\
Yes.

Participant F 00:10:08.600 -- 00:10:09.720 \\
Eighteen.

Participant F 00:10:13.720 -- 00:10:17.000 \\
Wait if I have here.

Participant F 00:10:27.800 -- 00:10:32.800 \\
The thing is only seventy seven. So this is energy demand.

Participant F 00:10:34.200 -- 00:10:43.160 \\
But the heating, the man should be the same. Now it should be also, but it's in energy wise, but electricity wise it should be different.

Miao, Yanwei 00:10:43.800 -- 00:10:49.400 \\
Yes, you are right? So here is actually a electricity.

Participant F 00:10:51.480 -- 00:10:57.720 \\
So this, this should be clarified. otherwise it looks like the hit pump uses a lot more energy.

Miao, Yanwei 00:10:57.880 -- 00:10:58.520 \\
All right.

Miao, Yanwei 00:10:59.160 -- 00:11:03.000 \\
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

Participant F 00:11:04.000 -- 00:11:08.080 \\
Energy electricity, maybe electricity map or you.

Participant F 00:11:10.680 -- 00:11:14.400 \\
Yeah, that's a big difference. If you show energy or electricity demands.

Miao, Yanwei 00:11:14.520 -- 00:11:17.160 \\
Yes, that's true.

Participant F 00:11:19.040 -- 00:11:20.280 \\
The current.

Participant F 00:11:22.200 -- 00:11:27.320 \\
Yeah, because then the current, oh, this is only appliances, right?

Miao, Yanwei 00:11:29.240 -- 00:11:47.800 \\
Obviously they didn't like distinguish from all the energy, all the lecturity that you were using, maybe because you don't have a tank or like those things and they can't identify, I'm guessing the model.

Participant F 00:11:49.240 -- 00:12:08.280 \\
Should be heating and hot water should be identified. I think here for sure, I think this could, yeah, here we have thought what I think we can have this distinguishing here too, but this is only the plans is it only prints the, yeah, the same, the plans are the same. The only prints the electricity consumption for.

Participant F 00:12:10.320 -- 00:12:13.560 \\
And not eating cooling.

Miao, Yanwei 00:12:18.240 -- 00:12:21.080 \\
Maybe it's wrong. You mean the model, I mean.

Participant F 00:12:21.720 -- 00:12:26.040 \\
It's just here the, what is plotted is missing.

Participant F 00:12:27.480 -- 00:12:31.320 \\
Is missing the hot water demand is not in this graph and.

Participant F 00:12:31.480 -- 00:12:35.800 \\
Missing the hitting as well hitting the month.

Miao, Yanwei 00:12:35.800 -- 00:12:43.480 \\
Can I, can I check? Can you scroll down a bit so that I can see your current energy system.

Miao, Yanwei 00:12:48.600 -- 00:12:56.280 \\
And do you mind, do you still remember whether you take the tank or the tank?

Participant F 00:12:56.280 -- 00:12:58.200 \\
I fixed the hotwater changes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:12:58.200 -- 00:13:00.240 \\
Okay, thank you.

Participant F 00:13:00.840 -- 00:13:02.680 \\
Yeah, it doesn't show.

Miao, Yanwei 00:13:02.680 -- 00:13:11.000 \\
No, I think maybe, maybe we didn't update of the web service, then maybe there is some bugs again.

Miao, Yanwei 00:13:14.520 -- 00:13:16.120 \\
This is the concept.

Participant F 00:13:16.120 -- 00:13:16.760 \\
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Participant F 00:13:18.760 -- 00:13:23.160 \\
I think it's good, but just, yeah, just to, to let you know, so here it should.

Participant F 00:13:24.520 -- 00:13:27.960 \\
And what I think it would be cool if you.

Participant F 00:13:30.200 -- 00:13:35.320 \\
So right now we have not the same access if we have the same access or maybe.

Participant F 00:13:38.520 -- 00:13:48.760 \\
If, if you create one graph and you have Ingray in the background, the current demand, and then the new demand on top of it with colors.

Participant F 00:13:50.160 -- 00:13:51.960 \\
To show a difference.

Miao, Yanwei 00:13:51.960 -- 00:14:02.120 \\
You mean the way how we show it now it doesn't have so constructed comparison.

Miao, Yanwei 00:14:04.120 -- 00:14:08.600 \\
So if they would be in one graph, it would be easier to identify.

Participant F 00:14:11.200 -- 00:14:21.200 \\
Probably maybe, but then again, it's difficult for, for electricity usage because when you switch from a gas pilot to a heat pump, you have much high electricity.

Participant F 00:14:22.040 -- 00:14:27.080 \\
So I think either, you have two.

Participant F 00:14:28.440 -- 00:14:36.120 \\
Because you should also show them gas consumption, oil consumption org or C- two savings in a different graph.

Participant F 00:14:36.800 -- 00:14:42.520 \\
Because when you switch to a hit one, then it should go on the one side to savings, should go up or.

Participant F 00:14:43.800 -- 00:14:48.920 \\
Emission should go down whenever you print, and then the electricity consumption goes up.

Miao, Yanwei 00:14:50.280 -- 00:14:58.400 \\
Is it possible to also calculate the consumption of oil.

Participant F 00:14:59.160 -- 00:15:02.360 \\
And it should be in the model.

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:02.360 -- 00:15:06.200 \\
Okay, all right. Makes sense.

Participant F 00:15:06.560 -- 00:15:11.320 \\
If you take notes something we will have a, probably a meeting.

Participant F 00:15:13.320 -- 00:15:14.440 \\
Information.

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:15.800 -- 00:15:17.880 \\
It's okay, it's good.

Participant F 00:15:22.200 -- 00:15:23.480 \\
Yeah, yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:24.120 -- 00:15:29.000 \\
Yes, but you have gone through all the pages, but like the critical pages.

Participant F 00:15:31.800 -- 00:15:36.800 \\
I mean, here we have everything and there's a lot more prev.

Participant F 00:15:40.120 -- 00:15:44.600 \\
Can I include the calling system here? Now?

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:45.560 -- 00:15:47.800 \\
You mean excluding the hitting.

Participant F 00:15:48.040 -- 00:15:50.360 \\
Including include calling system.

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:50.360 -- 00:15:52.920 \\
The coolings are no, no.

Participant F 00:15:53.680 -- 00:15:56.760 \\
I cannot, I cannot do this in afterwards, right?

Miao, Yanwei 00:15:56.760 -- 00:15:59.480 \\
Yes, because we.

Miao, Yanwei 00:16:00.760 -- 00:16:02.520 \\
Don't recommend you do.

Participant F 00:16:03.920 -- 00:16:04.440 \\
More energy.

Participant F 00:16:07.040 -- 00:16:08.880 \\
Cooling is recommended.

Miao, Yanwei 00:16:08.920 -- 00:16:19.240 \\
Yeah, so if you have a cooling system, we would just like to calculate the cooling system inside, but if you don't have one, then we don't recommend you to add one.

Miao, Yanwei 00:16:21.080 -- 00:16:21.720 \\
Yes, yes.

Participant F 00:16:21.720 -- 00:16:24.800 \\
Seven hundred eighteen and.

Miao, Yanwei 00:16:26.840 -- 00:16:38.200 \\
By the very unfortunately I think we made some problems with the, the current data that one, why doesn't it show the other bars.

Participant F 00:16:38.360 -- 00:16:41.520 \\
Yeah, here's a, here's.

Miao, Yanwei 00:16:42.840 -- 00:16:44.760 \\
Yes, I gonna check.

Participant F 00:16:45.520 -- 00:16:50.440 \\
Chose here to extract using this on solid dependent on the electricity.

Participant F 00:16:51.200 -- 00:16:53.720 \\
So, you know, here we show electricity demands.

Participant F 00:16:54.800 -- 00:17:06.520 \\
Because yeah, it's all, we show it it. So for this instance, this is also electricity in Mandia times. I don't know, the hit pump, is probably free.

Miao, Yanwei 00:17:09.720 -- 00:17:13.040 \\
The hot water you, you meant.

Participant F 00:17:14.280 -- 00:17:14.839 \\
Is supposed.

Participant F 00:17:16.160 -- 00:17:21.040 \\
Yeah, it's, you not water results in here.

Miao, Yanwei 00:17:21.880 -- 00:17:25.079 \\
Okay, I'll check it later to see.

Participant F 00:17:25.880 -- 00:17:34.040 \\
Send, it should also be, I think this is, this is nice to compare current simulate, maybe not put it in one bar. One chart.

Participant F 00:17:35.440 -- 00:17:37.880 \\
Showed it the charts have the same.

Miao, Yanwei 00:17:38.000 -- 00:17:39.160 \\
Unit, you mean.

Participant F 00:17:39.160 -- 00:17:51.320 \\
Same, same unit, same yxs, and also show the same things and I don't know about C- two emissions or savings of gas or whatever.

Participant F 00:17:54.840 -- 00:17:55.800 \\
That's another.

Miao, Yanwei 00:17:56.200 -- 00:18:04.760 \\
You think co- two emission? It's why is it important for you to be consistent?

Participant F 00:18:04.760 -- 00:18:17.560 \\
I think, I think it's, it's a good selling point to do, for example, switch to a heat a heat come because when you switch from a gas boiler.

Participant F 00:18:21.440 -- 00:18:31.000 \\
Electricity is much lower. So people could think, oh, guess what is actually better because they use less electricity, right? And there's no.

Miao, Yanwei 00:18:31.000 -- 00:18:32.280 \\
Yes, yes.

Participant F 00:18:32.280 -- 00:18:35.280 \\
There's not nothing that tells you.

Participant F 00:18:37.080 -- 00:18:46.080 \\
Yeah, I guess you think only goes up because the Pvs used for, for pitting with the.

Miao, Yanwei 00:18:47.760 -- 00:18:55.320 \\
But if you, if you see the energy Bill, so if you see the bell.

Miao, Yanwei 00:18:56.080 -- 00:19:03.640 \\
It's actually like way lower than the current will be.

Participant F 00:19:04.640 -- 00:19:06.120 \\
Yeah, true.

Participant F 00:19:07.480 -- 00:19:10.040 \\
This, this is a huge difference that's true.

Miao, Yanwei 00:19:10.680 -- 00:19:14.120 \\
And not that visible, I have to admit.

Participant F 00:19:15.160 -- 00:19:19.000 \\
I mean, you know, it is visible, I think.

Participant F 00:19:20.280 -- 00:19:21.560 \\
To think it's cool.

Miao, Yanwei 00:19:24.760 -- 00:19:30.520 \\
And there's actually one more page. I don't know if you have noticed if you go down.

Miao, Yanwei 00:19:31.280 -- 00:19:33.720 \\
Yes, the green page. Yes, the cart.

Participant F 00:19:34.360 -- 00:19:37.160 \\
Oh, I'm just new christma.

Miao, Yanwei 00:19:37.560 -- 00:19:50.920 \\
Yes, and these are some additional information regarding climate change and what you can do as individual households to save some energy for your house.

Miao, Yanwei 00:19:54.200 -- 00:19:57.640 \\
But it's just like some additional information.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:01.240 -- 00:20:05.120 \\
Yes, yes, now you've gone through all the pages.

Participant F 00:20:17.360 -- 00:20:18.480 \\
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:19.920 -- 00:20:24.760 \\
All right, so do you have any questions regarding the interfaces?

Participant F 00:20:28.880 -- 00:20:31.120 \\
That's pretty clear to.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:32.080 -- 00:20:37.800 \\
And then shall we start with the, the questions, the remaining questions.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:38.480 -- 00:20:39.120 \\
Okay.

Participant F 00:20:39.920 -- 00:20:42.320 \\
Should I start? I'll stop sharing my SC.

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:42.560 -- 00:20:49.920 \\
Yes, you can stop sharing. So how do you feel about the recommendation provided?

Miao, Yanwei 00:20:53.840 -- 00:20:59.320 \\
So do you find those recommendations useful or valuable?

Participant F 00:21:00.920 -- 00:21:11.120 \\
Yeah, I like, I like to difference between the cost cost benefit choice and minimum energy build thing.

Miao, Yanwei 00:21:11.160 -- 00:21:21.800 \\
Okay, good, and are you considering investing in any of the recommendation like recommended technologist there?

Participant F 00:21:24.560 -- 00:21:25.840 \\
Personally, I can't.

Participant F 00:21:29.680 -- 00:21:38.000 \\
My parents are considering it and they will probably check again, they will go for a PV system, which is around five Kilow Peak.

Participant F 00:21:39.680 -- 00:21:42.200 \\
The smart Energy Management system.

Participant F 00:21:45.040 -- 00:21:48.920 \\
I actually don't know what is on the market yet. What kind of smart.

Miao, Yanwei 00:21:50.240 -- 00:21:57.840 \\
So you, you meant that you also used your parents' house situation to do the testing, right?

Miao, Yanwei 00:21:59.120 -- 00:22:19.600 \\
And I think according to the recommendation, it didn't actually say that installing a PV can be most cost benefit because actually, the investment is a little bit more than the energy that you can save the money you can save from saving the energy.

Participant F 00:22:20.320 -- 00:22:28.400 \\
But I think I'm actually now that I think about it adding a PV system, if I actually load peak, it should have, I should have positive.

Participant F 00:22:30.520 -- 00:22:32.400 \\
Take a positive payback.

Miao, Yanwei 00:22:33.040 -- 00:22:42.000 \\
It, it does like it saves your energy, like the total energy bell, but actually your investment into.

Participant F 00:22:45.240 -- 00:23:00.400 \\
It shouldn't be that way. I think for PV, maybe right now the prices are high, but still after usually PV is for households, depending on if you use energy, if you're a top working from home or if anyone is at home using that electricity.

Participant F 00:23:04.440 -- 00:23:10.160 \\
I know from the market that people, especially with subsidies, I mean, subsidies are not included. Red.

Miao, Yanwei 00:23:12.080 -- 00:23:12.720 \\
I guess not.

Participant F 00:23:13.360 -- 00:23:17.200 \\
Yeah, I mean we could also read maybe a note.

Participant F 00:23:20.520 -- 00:23:24.080 \\
Subsidize PV, then it's a huge benefit.

Miao, Yanwei 00:23:25.640 -- 00:23:30.000 \\
But like this will be different in different countries, right?

Participant F 00:23:30.000 -- 00:23:35.120 \\
This would be different in different countries and even within countries in different regions, it's different.

Participant F 00:23:36.720 -- 00:23:48.560 \\
Depends on where you live how much PV subsidized in Australia as well in Vienna, you get subsidies and all up to fifty percent. I think, I don't know. I have to check.

Participant F 00:23:49.320 -- 00:23:49.840 \\
Suddenly.

Participant F 00:23:51.920 -- 00:23:53.040 \\
It's worth it was.

Participant F 00:23:53.880 -- 00:24:02.000 \\
For sure and isn't even without the subsidies, usually it's now with rising electricity prices, it's worth it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:24:02.000 -- 00:24:10.480 \\
Okay, so would you say, actually you have suspect to where's the recommendation.

Participant F 00:24:11.600 -- 00:24:16.720 \\
I think the recommendation is underestimating the cost Benef.

Participant F 00:24:20.120 -- 00:24:20.560 \\
I don't know.

Miao, Yanwei 00:24:23.760 -- 00:24:39.120 \\
So it's more like the, your suspect it's more towards the, the energy bell because you think there would be like, maybe, so it's from the government and then some, some other policies that can help the financial, those a bit lower.

Participant F 00:24:41.160 -- 00:24:46.640 \\
Annual investment cost could be lower for PB.

Miao, Yanwei 00:24:47.000 -- 00:24:47.440 \\
Specific.

Participant F 00:24:48.080 -- 00:24:50.640 \\
For the other systems, I have no idea.

Miao, Yanwei 00:24:50.640 -- 00:25:04.680 \\
All right, that's, that's great insight. Thank you for providing me that and what factors influence your decision to adopt or reject the recommendations.

Participant F 00:25:08.680 -- 00:25:09.840 \\
Good question.

Participant F 00:25:11.120 -- 00:25:19.440 \\
What I mean, I think for the lowest energy factors that probably the, the annualized cost.

Miao, Yanwei 00:25:21.400 -- 00:25:23.280 \\
Investment, yes.

Participant F 00:25:28.400 -- 00:25:40.560 \\
Yeah, maybe here I would have to play what, how much is the, if I exclude the battery system, we put the, oh, wait.

Participant F 00:25:41.840 -- 00:25:44.280 \\
The investment cost is not being updated.

Participant F 00:25:45.840 -- 00:25:47.600 \\
Screen again, one second.

Miao, Yanwei 00:25:48.480 -- 00:25:51.800 \\
Do you mean the simulation page?

Participant F 00:25:52.080 -- 00:25:55.280 \\
Yes, here if I have the battery.

Participant F 00:25:58.480 -- 00:25:59.760 \\
Energy business, five hundred.

Participant F 00:26:02.320 -- 00:26:03.600 \\
It's a backyard.

Participant F 00:26:04.240 -- 00:26:08.720 \\
Give it away. The investment cost is still the same.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:09.080 -- 00:26:11.360 \\
A lot of bugs of the system.

Participant F 00:26:12.560 -- 00:26:13.200 \\
It should.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:13.840 -- 00:26:25.360 \\
It can be less yes, but if you click the better assistant, yes, if you scroll down a little bit, you will find no, like within the Bettery system.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:26.000 -- 00:26:29.720 \\
And in the end, there is an.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:31.360 -- 00:26:34.320 \\
Inside here, and then there is a green text.

Participant F 00:26:34.320 -- 00:26:35.600 \\
Ah, here.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:36.440 -- 00:26:40.720 \\
In the better resistant, this drop down menu.

Participant F 00:26:40.720 -- 00:26:41.360 \\
Yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:41.560 -- 00:26:48.400 \\
There are some descriptions, right? If you change it, there is a green text.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:49.320 -- 00:26:50.320 \\
At the bottom.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:51.360 -- 00:26:53.480 \\
The analyzed cost.

Participant F 00:26:55.520 -- 00:26:57.360 \\
Course should be reduced from here.

Miao, Yanwei 00:26:57.360 -- 00:27:03.760 \\
Yes, I'm supposed to calculate it, but seems like there's a bug.

Participant F 00:27:05.680 -- 00:27:08.240 \\
Easy to create these pages. I know.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:08.880 -- 00:27:12.720 \\
The system is not very mature. It's a bit immature yet.

Participant F 00:27:13.360 -- 00:27:14.640 \\
Yeah, yeah.

Participant F 00:27:15.920 -- 00:27:21.040 \\
Do you, how, how do you create this website with what, what are you using?

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:21.200 -- 00:27:28.080 \\
It's actually, we have a backend, Javas Javascript, again. I think.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:31.320 -- 00:27:36.400 \\
All the data is supposed to be retrieved from the database we use the database.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:38.320 -- 00:27:46.640 \\
Yes, we didn't directly apply the model, like we didn't directly send everything to the model and let the model calculate because.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:47.280 -- 00:27:47.920 \\
Time.

Participant F 00:27:48.840 -- 00:27:49.200 \\
Yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:50.480 -- 00:27:53.040 \\
So they, they are all retrieved from the database.

Miao, Yanwei 00:27:56.880 -- 00:28:01.560 \\
But you found many problems already.

Participant F 00:28:04.280 -- 00:28:08.400 \\
It doesn't change. Yeah, okay, it never changes whatever.

Miao, Yanwei 00:28:09.040 -- 00:28:12.720 \\
Yeah, so you would say that the influence.

Miao, Yanwei 00:28:14.920 -- 00:28:22.840 \\
Financial related, either, it's like investment or the final total energy, those, those are the triggers.

Participant F 00:28:23.120 -- 00:28:26.960 \\
I mean, this is also what is basically shown here, right?

Miao, Yanwei 00:28:28.240 -- 00:28:28.880 \\
That's where we.

Participant F 00:28:31.440 -- 00:28:36.000 \\
That's why, that's why I said, maybe two savings could also be.

Participant F 00:28:37.280 -- 00:28:40.000 \\
Good point is something to point out...

Participant F 00:28:41.040 -- 00:28:45.600 \\
There's an addition of like benefit.

Miao, Yanwei 00:28:49.360 -- 00:28:51.200 \\
Oh, wait, then.

Miao, Yanwei 00:28:52.560 -- 00:28:56.720 \\
You know, why the recommendations were recommended to you.

Participant F 00:29:01.520 -- 00:29:04.080 \\
No, or what you mean.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:05.160 -- 00:29:23.960 \\
Like, do you think the recommendations were, will be recommended to every user and the recommendations will be all similar recommendations or do you think this recommendations were recommended to you based on your previous input?

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:28.040 -- 00:29:31.800 \\
General recommendation or it's personalized recommendation.

Participant F 00:29:32.880 -- 00:29:43.120 \\
I think it's, it's personalized, but okay for the laws and attributes, I think it's very general because it just updates to the maximum of everything, right?

Participant F 00:29:46.560 -- 00:29:50.160 \\
Big battery, big PV renovative building.

Participant F 00:29:52.080 -- 00:29:53.360 \\
Energy management.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:53.360 -- 00:29:56.560 \\
The technologies, they are the same.

Miao, Yanwei 00:29:57.200 -- 00:29:59.240 \\
Selection of technologies.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:01.760 -- 00:30:07.320 \\
But the simulation and the sizes are chosen.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:10.340 -- 00:30:12.180 \\
This personal list.

Participant F 00:30:12.180 -- 00:30:16.020 \\
Yeah, okay, so the cost benefit is personalized, right?

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:16.660 -- 00:30:17.300 \\
Yes, yes.

Participant F 00:30:19.460 -- 00:30:21.780 \\
The lowest investment, probably too.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:23.140 -- 00:30:24.340 \\
All personalized actually.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:25.500 -- 00:30:30.100 \\
Like for different households, the numbers are always different. So.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:31.460 -- 00:30:37.140 \\
Yeah, we need to like play around with the numbers and then found those three recommendations, so they are.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:39.700 -- 00:30:46.100 \\
Your situation, but did you realize that when you were doing it like before I tell you this.

Participant F 00:30:46.740 -- 00:30:53.620 \\
I think the, I think I realistic for the, for the safe, let the cost benefit. It's.

Participant F 00:30:53.780 -- 00:30:58.900 \\
I mean, it's a, you know, I didn't really think about it, but I think it's clear.

Miao, Yanwei 00:30:58.900 -- 00:31:00.020 \\
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:31:02.900 -- 00:31:09.980 \\
Then it's continue and do you trust the recommendations? Why or why not.

Participant F 00:31:13.620 -- 00:31:25.780 \\
Yeah, I trust. So the cost benefit, I trust, I trust it. Yeah, I trusted, I mean, I already said that maybe the PV is a bit too expensive.

Participant F 00:31:26.420 -- 00:31:28.300 \\
Compared to savings.

Miao, Yanwei 00:31:28.540 -- 00:31:35.220 \\
Do you trust the recommendation? Do you think the model is correct or.

Participant F 00:31:37.300 -- 00:31:46.260 \\
Yes, and I also noted just because I'm in energy I worked in this field.

Participant F 00:31:46.900 -- 00:31:53.300 \\
I can somehow, let's say, say that this makes sense.

Miao, Yanwei 00:31:53.340 -- 00:31:56.500 \\
Okay, yes, that, that's important. Yeah.

Miao, Yanwei 00:31:57.780 -- 00:32:04.980 \\
And what factors contribute to your trust or a lack of trust in the recommendations?

Miao, Yanwei 00:32:10.580 -- 00:32:20.180 \\
If you don't trust the model, if you don't trust the recommendation, what would be the reason that you don't trust, and if you trust a lot of what.

Participant F 00:32:20.980 -- 00:32:29.140 \\
If I don't trust, it would be now because the, cost don't update and the charts don't show the same thing on the current simulation.

Miao, Yanwei 00:32:29.140 -- 00:32:30.260 \\
Yes.

Miao, Yanwei 00:32:33.740 -- 00:32:36.180 \\
The recommendation you think.

Participant F 00:32:36.180 -- 00:32:38.100 \\
The recommendation is fine. Now.

Miao, Yanwei 00:32:38.100 -- 00:32:39.220 \\
Okay.

Miao, Yanwei 00:32:41.980 -- 00:32:48.940 \\
So I guess you were very familiar with all the technologists before using the surveys already.

Participant F 00:32:50.420 -- 00:32:53.020 \\
Familiar, I mean, I, I.

Participant F 00:32:54.740 -- 00:32:56.660 \\
Worked on a model.

Miao, Yanwei 00:32:58.100 -- 00:33:04.980 \\
And did the system provide enough information for you to understand the technologies? You think.

Participant F 00:33:05.820 -- 00:33:09.460 \\
Yes, but I think I just found another thing that might be.

Participant F 00:33:15.900 -- 00:33:17.140 \\
Might be worth.

Participant F 00:33:19.180 -- 00:33:22.260 \\
And I go to this and I look at the energy build.

Participant F 00:33:24.820 -- 00:33:29.940 \\
I'm pretty sure this hitting since I have a boiler.

Miao, Yanwei 00:33:29.940 -- 00:33:31.060 \\
Yes.

Participant F 00:33:31.900 -- 00:33:36.980 \\
And this is electricity, this is the, this is electric direct heating.

Participant F 00:33:38.260 -- 00:33:50.140 \\
So maybe we need to either show that we have a tank with direct electricity that this is, this is basically.

Participant F 00:33:50.500 -- 00:33:55.540 \\
Estimated, or this is that we think we have this...

Participant F 00:34:00.660 -- 00:34:02.580 \\
Otherwise, this wouldn't be possible, right?

Miao, Yanwei 00:34:03.420 -- 00:34:10.460 \\
Do you mean like, if you scroll down a little bit, there is a small information there.

Miao, Yanwei 00:34:12.220 -- 00:34:20.820 \\
Up a little bit and up still up like under, yes, under the energy demand.

Participant F 00:34:21.139 -- 00:34:26.260 \\
Yes, and no, no, this is not since it's all even on interest today.

Participant F 00:34:26.899 -- 00:34:42.899 \\
No, because we still, we show here electricity and they use doesn't know where this electricity comes from for heating, right? So this is heating electricity if we have electricity here, this is used for heating, but we have a gas boiler here and what the model does.

Miao, Yanwei 00:34:42.899 -- 00:34:43.540 \\
It.

Participant F 00:34:44.179 -- 00:34:48.020 \\
PB ELECTRICITY into heating because we have a hot water tank.

Participant F 00:34:49.300 -- 00:34:58.260 \\
And this needs to be explained either because Somehouses won't have this if they have PV installed, So.

Participant F 00:35:00.260 -- 00:35:07.740 \\
That's basically not something that we need to distinguish buildings with, and without direct electricity.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:08.500 -- 00:35:15.180 \\
Okay, yes, okay. It's because you have a tank queries because you.

Participant F 00:35:15.580 -- 00:35:16.820 \\
Because we have a tank.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:16.860 -- 00:35:17.460 \\
Okay, yeah.

Participant F 00:35:17.460 -- 00:35:25.140 \\
And the model can use surplus PV electricity, instead of selling it to the grid to hit the to heat the.

Participant F 00:35:26.060 -- 00:35:32.820 \\
Direct electricating, but this is a- this is not implemented in every hot water time as far as I know.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:36.020 -- 00:35:38.420 \\
There are a lot of things to clarify.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:41.140 -- 00:35:44.540 \\
Thank you, thank you for letting me know.

Participant F 00:35:45.620 -- 00:35:46.260 \\
No, wor.

Participant F 00:35:48.180 -- 00:35:49.460 \\
It's a lot of work.

Miao, Yanwei 00:35:54.180 -- 00:36:02.260 \\
Do you believe that adopting this technology can lead to lower energy costs? I thank you. You answered that.

Miao, Yanwei 00:36:09.940 -- 00:36:13.780 \\
Yeah, then I guess all the questions were answered.

Participant F 00:36:13.780 -- 00:36:14.900 \\
Perfect.

Miao, Yanwei 00:36:15.700 -- 00:36:17.540 \\
Thank you very much.

Participant F 00:36:20.260 -- 00:36:21.460 \\
Yeah, thank you too.

Miao, Yanwei 00:36:22.100 -- 00:36:31.700 \\
And do you have any additional thoughts or concerns regarding the system or recommendations besides what you already told me?

Participant F 00:36:33.060 -- 00:36:35.540 \\
How you set up the pages is really nice.

Miao, Yanwei 00:36:35.580 -- 00:36:36.980 \\
Thank you.

Participant F 00:36:37.460 -- 00:36:40.020 \\
So you, you study.

Miao, Yanwei 00:36:40.940 -- 00:36:42.580 \\
Computer interaction.

Participant F 00:36:43.340 -- 00:36:47.700 \\
Yeah, so, so it's also this, you, you use some design, the red.

Participant F 00:36:49.620 -- 00:36:50.260 \\
Yeah, that's nice.

Miao, Yanwei 00:36:50.260 -- 00:36:57.300 \\
But obviously, there are some, some more things to be explained in more detail obvious.

Participant F 00:36:59.220 -- 00:37:08.180 \\
Yeah, but, but from the, from the, what do you say, visual aspects? It's unlike it.

Miao, Yanwei 00:37:08.820 -- 00:37:13.260 \\
As it is clear enough for you to understand that.
