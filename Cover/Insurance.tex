I certify that I have prepared the written elaboration independently and have not used any other aids than those specified. All passages that are taken from other works in terms of wording or meaning (including translations) have been clearly identified as borrowing in each individual case, giving precise details of the source (including the World Wide Web and other electronic data collections). This also applies to attached drawings, pictorial representations, sketches and the like. I acknowledge that the proven omission of the indication of origin will be assessed as an attempted deception.
