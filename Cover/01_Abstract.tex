\noindent

The transition to clean energy and energy-efficient technologies is crucial for reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change. 
However, households lack the sufficient knowledge and guidance on these technologies, including the potential benefits that can be obtained through their adoption.
This study aims to fill the information gap and support decision-making on the adoption of clean energy and energy technologies for house owners. 
Design Case Studies will be used as the research framework. 
%A website software will be developed to provide households with personalised and professional home energy system recommendations and techno-economic assessments. 
%The interfaces will be designed based on the findings from a pre-study conducted through literature review. 
%Real household users will use the intervention and provide feedback through both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. 
%This research will contribute to the HCI community by providing an understanding of how technology can be used to promote the adoption of clean energy and energy technologies in households, 
%and by identifying the effectiveness of personalised recommendations in supporting behaviour change.
