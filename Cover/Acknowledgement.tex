    {\Large{\bf{ACKNOWLEDGEMENT}}}
\end{center}

\noindent
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my thesis advisors. 
First, I am deeply thankful to Prof. Dr. Gunnar Stevens for his guidance, support, and insights throughout the research process at Siegen University. 
I also want to convey my appreciation to Dr. Songmin Yu, my supervisor at The Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research. 
His knowledge and support in merging HCI research with real-world applications have significantly enriched the quality of this thesis.
Together, their combined guidance has been integral to the completion of this research project, and I am truly grateful for the opportunity to benefit from their expertise and continuous feedback. 
In addition, I want to extend my thanks to Raphael Schlarb for his assistance with backend development. 
Without his expertise, realising the online service in such a short period would not have been possible.
