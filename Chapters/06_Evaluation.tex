\chapter{Evaluation}

In this chapter, we present the evaluation of our IT artefact. 
The evaluation focuses on two main aspects. 
Firstly, we assess the effectiveness of the explanations provided to users in helping them understand why specific configurations were recommended for their home energy systems.
Secondly, we evaluate whether the information presented through the explanations has an impact on users' attitudes, such as increased awareness of energy-efficient technologies or a stronger inclination to adopt them. 
To capture the subjective perception of users, we conducted user studies.
