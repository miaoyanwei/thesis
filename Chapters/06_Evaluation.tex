\chapter{Evaluation}

In this chapter, we present the evaluation of our IT artefact. 
The evaluation study focuses on two main aspects. 
Firstly, we assess the effectiveness of the explanations provided to users in helping them understand why specific configurations were recommended for their home energy systems.
Secondly, we evaluate whether the information presented through the explanations has an impact on users' attitudes, such as increased awareness of energy-efficient technologies or a stronger inclination to adopt them. 
 
As highlighted in Nunes and Jannach's summary \cite{Nunes2020}, 
there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes a correct or best explanation, 
evaluating the quality of explanations relies on capturing the subjective perceptions of users and monitoring the impact of these explanations on user behaviour, 
and user studies have been the predominant research method for assessing explanations in recommender systems.
Aligned with this understanding, our goal of capturing the subjective perceptions of users regarding the explanations provided and assessing any changes in their attitudes, 
we have made the decision to conduct real-user studies. 

Due to time constraints imposed by the university's requirements for a master's thesis, we conducted qualitative user studies with \textcolor{cyan}{6} participants in the \textcolor{cyan}{South Germany} region. 
While the sample size was small, qualitative studies provide valuable insights into rusers' perceptions, attitudes, and experiences.


\section{Semi-structured interviews}

The interview will follow the structured format to gather insights from the participants. 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Express gratitude to the interviewee for their willingness to participate and introduce myself briefly.
  \item Provide a brief recap of the project, emphasising its purposes, and clarify the specific objectives of the interview.
  \item Inform the interviewee about the expected duration of the interview (approximately 40 minutes) and assure them that the recording will be used solely for transcription purposes, ensuring confidentiality.
  \item Explain that the interview will involve participants using the web service to explore and discover recommendations tailored to their home energy systems.
  \item Prior to participants using the service, they will be asked a series of questions pertaining to their demographic information and initial perceptions of energy technologies.
  \item Allow participants to utilise the service using a laptop.
  \item Once the participants have interacted with the service, other questions will be asked.
  \item Inquire if the interviewee has any remaining questions or uncertainties.
  \item Express appreciation once again for their participation and inform them that they can reach out with any further concerns or inquiries they may have.
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Target groups}

The target users of this study are individuals residing in Germany who own single-family houses.
The participants were recruited using a convenient sampling approach. 
We employed a snowball technique by reaching out to acquaintances to inquire about their residence in a single-family house or their knowledge of individuals residing in such properties. 
Additionally, we extended our recruitment efforts to colleagues within Fraunhofer ISI.

The interview invitation is:

Are you a homeowner in Germany with a single-family house? 
Do you want to make informed investment decisions about energy technologies for your home? 
If so, we invite you to participate in a 40-minute interview for our web service developed in collaboration with the University of Siegen.
Don't miss out on the opportunity to test our web service, which provides personalised techno-economic investment recommendations tailored to your unique home situation. 
During the interview, you will use our online service and share your experience.

\subsubsection{Welcome}

Thank you for participating in this interview. 
My name is Yanwei Miao, and I am currently working on my master's thesis project in collaboration with Fraunhofer ISI.
We developed a web service to help homeowners like you make informed decisions about investing in energy technologies for your homes. 
Our aim is to provide personalised recommendations based on your specific circumstances, enabling you to determine the economic feasibility of implementing these technologies. 
To proceed, we kindly request your cooperation in answering a few questions about your background. 
This will help us gain a better understanding of your knowledge and perspective on AI and energy. 
Once is complete, we will guide you through the web service to obtain personalised recommendations for your home energy system. 
While using the service, we encourage you to think out loud and share your thoughts and observations. 
Afterward, we will conduct a 30-minute interview to gather your feedback and insights. 
If you have any questions at any point, please don't hesitate to ask. 
Are you ready to begin?


\subsubsection{Questions}

The interview questions can be categorised into four main categories: \emph{demography, explainability, attitude change, and additional questions}.
Demography questions focus on gathering information about the background of the interviewees, aiming to identify any demographic factors that may influence their interest in more detailed explanations.
Explainability questions are designed to assess the clarity and comprehensibility of the provided explanations, aiming to determine if they are clear and understandable to the participants. 
Attitude change questions are divided into two parts: before using the service and after using the service. 
These questions aim to capture any changes in participants' attitudes towards energy technologies and their perception of the recommendations after using the service.
Lastly, additional questions or thoughts may arise during the interview. 
They could be an opportunity to explore additional insights or address any specific concerns during the conversation.

\section{Future work: Kano survey}

The Kano model \cite{Sauerwein1996} is a commonly used framework in quantitative research to understand customer satisfaction and prioritise features or attributes. 
In our project, we aim to also incorporate the Kano model survey (Table \ref{tab:kanomodel}) as part of our future work. 
We plan to integrate this survey directly into the web service, allowing individuals who have interacted with the service online to voluntarily complete the survey.
Through the integration of the Kano survey into the web service, we have the opportunity to collect insights from users who engage with the service online. 
This will enable us to assess whether the inclusion of specific features in the service brings delight to our users.
This assessment will help us determine the necessity of explanations in the service.

  \label{tab:participants_perceptions}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Participant A}

Before using the service, 
Participant A, who works in the house construction industry, 
displayed knowledge of EU energy policy and familiarity with energy-efficient appliances and renewable energy technologies. 
He had implemented solar panels in one of his houses and believed in their ability to reduce energy costs for households. 
Participant A emphasised the rising energy prices and the importance of addressing climate change, expressing dissatisfaction with Germany's continued use of coal. 

During the service usage, 
Participant A found the service to work smoothly, receiving a comprehensive list of around 50 recommendations to lower energy costs. 
While he agreed with most configurations, he felt overwhelmed by the extensive list and preferred to focus on specific options such as installing a heat pump and conducting a house renovation, given his expertise in his own house's needs. 
Despite not finding recommendations for biomass utilisation, Participant 1 relied on his professional experience and personal resources in considering biomass as the most cost-effective option. 
Although he missed the last level of explanation on renewable energy benefits, he clicked to view more details on the specific recommendation he sought.

After using the service, 
Participant A appreciated the recommendations but felt they were more suited for general houses rather than his unique situation. 
Financial considerations and environmental impact guided his energy technology decisions. 
Trusting the recommendations due to his familiarity with them, he acknowledged the service provided an overwhelming amount of information and a surplus of recommendations.


\subsubsection{Participant B}

Before using the service, 
Participant B, who works in the renewable energy industry, 
expressed a strong awareness of climate change and a desire to implement energy-efficient technologies and measures in his house primarily for economic reasons.

During the service usage, 
Participant B found the service to be simple, clean, and straightforward, which he appreciated. 
Although the service did not consider his electric car, he believed the estimation of the remaining energy bill to be accurate. 
He found the information on investment costs to be useful and liked the ability to adjust settings to see changes in energy demand and bill. 
While he noticed the "why turn to renewable energy" card, he did not click to view it.

After using the service, 
Participant B found it particularly helpful in determining the appropriate sizes for investment consideration. 
He believed that implementing these technologies could lead to energy cost savings, 
but expressed concern about the upfront investment amount, which posed a barrier for him. 
He suggested that government assistance in the form of support for monthly payments or other financial incentives could make green living more accessible. 
Participant B also suggested that the service should offer more comprehensive guidance on getting started 
and allow for more detailed inputs, such as providing options to enter specific details like roof size and receive insulation recommendations. 
He expressed trust in the recommendations, as the energy bill was accurate when not considering the electric car. 
The well-programmed and responsive website service contributed to his trust as well, and he appreciated that the interface was not overly complicated.


\subsubsection{Participant C}

Before using the service, 
Participant C, a current master's student in human-computer interaction, 
admitted that she doesn't have much knowledge or interest in artificial intelligence, energy, or energy technologies. 
She does have a smart thermostat installed on her heater, which was provided by her landlord, and she is familiar with how it operates. 
Additionally, her colleagues at work have also shared their experiences with smart thermostats, as many of them have one. 
She holds the belief that the concept of ,,energy efficiency" does not necessarily mean conserving energy but rather generating energy more efficiently, while ensuring human comfort.

During the service usage, 
Participant C carefully read all the explanation texts for each technology while providing the current configuration of her house. 
She wanted to ensure that she answered correctly. 
When selecting the battery capacity, she wasn't entirely sure about the size of the battery in her house, but with only two options available, she quickly made her choice, believing that the battery in her house should be a larger one.
After receiving the estimates of her current annual energy bill, Participant C calculated the monthly bill herself and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was very precise. 
She then proceeded to choose a recommendation and closely examined the accompanying energy graphs. 
Noticing that the energy demand bars for each month showed variations, with less demand in the summer and more in the winter, she found this pattern to be logical and sensible.
However, she also encountered a confusing aspect when she noticed an energy bar for cooling, even though she didn't have an air conditioner in her house. This information puzzled her. 
Participant C also clicked on the climate change education card to quickly scan its content and appreciated the information being presented in that section.

After using the service, 
Participant C found it to be a potential replacement for the Energieausweis, a nation-wide recognised standard in Germany for displaying a house's energy-efficiency level, which people usually need to pay professionals for. 
She appreciated that the recommendations were presented in a neutral manner, 
but suggested that more eye-catching visuals could make her feel the significant impact of potential savings and encourage her to make changes.

Participant C felt that the recommendations might not perfectly align with her own situation,
because the questions asked in terms of her energy consumption behaviours, were relatively general. 
She believed that more detailed and private questions could lead to a more personalised calculation. 
Regarding trust, she initially believed in the service, 
especially after seeing that the estimated energy bill was accurate. 
However, when she encountered confusion in the graph, her trust in the system wavered. 
Participant C had concerns that the service might be promoted by business companies with the intention to sell their products. 
This led her to believe that the algorithm behind the model might be biased and pushing users to spend money. 
However, after it was clarified that the project was solely a research-driven initiative sponsored by the EU without any commercial influence, she gained more trust in the service.
To further validate her trust in the system, she decided to test it by inputting the best energy configuration. 
The service did not provide any recommendation for this situation, which reinforced her belief that the system was not solely focused on pushing users to spend money. 
This positive experience increased her trust in the service and the recommendations. 

Participant C also mentioned that her investment willingness was influenced by various factors, 
including how long she planned to stay in her current house and whether she could take the technologies with her when moving. 
In her background, households were not allowed to privately install \gls{pv} systems without obtaining a certificate from authorities, 
and selling excess electricity back to the grid was prohibited. 
which differs from Europe where governments encourage \gls{pv} installations. 
Upon learning about these differences, she became enthusiastic about installing a PV system, 
recognising its benefits in both cost savings and contributing to environmental preservation.

Despite not having much prior knowledge of energy technologies, 
Participant C was able to answer all questions about her current house after reading the descriptions provided. 
She mentioned that the service allowed her to gain a rough understanding of these technologies but expected to learn more detailed benefits and information through the platform.
