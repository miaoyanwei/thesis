\chapter{Introduction} 

To tackle climate change and its negative impacts, 
the historic Paris Agreement 
sets long-term goals to guide all nations 
to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas (\gls{ghg}) emissions 
to limit the global temperature increase
to 2 degrees Celsius in this century \cite{paris}. 
In 2019, 
80.9\% of our total energy supply still depended on burning fossil fuels, 
namely 
26.8\% coal, 30.9\% oil and 23.2\% natural gas \cite{iea}. 
However, 
investments into low-carbon power generation 
accounted for 15\% recently 
are expected to rise to more than 30\% by 2030, 
corresponding to a quadrupling in absolute volumes \cite{shift}. 
Solar, wind, and the investments 
for enabling the integration of these technologies to the grid 
dominate the investments into low-carbon power generation \cite{shift}.
