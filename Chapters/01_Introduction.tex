\chapter{Introduction} 

Human-induced climate change is causing dangerous and widespread disruption in nature and affecting the lives of billions of people around the world \cite{ipcc}. 
To tackle climate change and its negative impacts, the historic Paris Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas (\gls{ghg}) emissions to limit the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius in this century \cite{paris}. 
On European Union (\gls{eu}) level, 
“Energy 2020. A strategy for competitive, sustainable and secure energy”, published in November 2010, and “Energy Roadmap 2050”, published at the end of 2011, are the most important strategy papers currently, pointing the direction for energy developments in the \gls{eu} \cite{roadmap}. 
The aim is to confirm Europe's commitment to lead in global climate action and to present a vision that can lead to achieving net-zero \gls{ghg} emissions by 2050 through a socially-fair transition in a cost-efficient manner \cite{clean}. 

To achieve these goals, 
two central strategies are pursued by the \gls{eu} and its Member States concerning the energy system \cite{2050}: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Enhancing energy efficiency (EE). 
  \item Decarbonizing energy supply, 
  in particular via large diffusion 
  and wide-use of renewable energy sources.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Energy shift}

In 2019, 80.9\% of our total energy supply still depended on burning fossil fuels, namely 26.8\% coal, 30.9\% oil and 23.2\% natural gas \cite{iea}. 
Nonetheless, investments into low-carbon power generation accounted for 15\% recently are expected to rise to more than 30\% by 2030, corresponding to a quadrupling in absolute volumes \cite{shift}. Solar, wind, and the investments for enabling the integration of these technologies to the grid dominate the investments into low-carbon power generation \cite{shift}. 

\section{Societal trends}

Previous research has shown that in many areas energy efficiency gains were counteracted by societal trends that increased corresponding activities, leading to much smaller decreases (or even increases) of energy demand than technologically feasible \cite{2050}. 
Therefore, 
it is important to access current and (foreseeable) future societal trends concerning the impact that they might have on future energy demand \cite{2050}.

Climate change can only be tackled if people actively engage, as consumers and as citizens \cite{clean}.
