\chapter{Methodology} 

The study uses Design Case Studies \cite{dcs} as the research framework. 


\section{Phase one}

In the pre-study phase, 
an empirical analysis is conducted to examine the practices and tools used in the home energy sector. 
The main objective is to identify effective methods that can support households in making informed decisions about renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies. 
However, due to the limited availability of successful initiatives in this field, alternative options, including energy audits and research models, are being explored as potential solutions. 


\section{Phase two}

comes up with an innovative design for an ICT artifact related to the findings of the first phase


\section{Phase three}

investigates into the appropriation of the technical artifact over a longer period of time. 

%The methodology adopted in this study is based on the Design Case Studies framework. 
%The pre-study phase will begin by conducting a comprehensive review of the literature to identify best practices for providing households with personalised and professional home energy system recommendations, as well as techno-economic assessments.
%Based on the findings from the pre-study, I will then design the interfaces of the intervention. 
%The interfaces will be developed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience that can easily be understood by households. 
%Following the development phase, real users will be invited to use the intervention, and feedback will be collected both qualitatively and quantitatively. 
%The qualitative data will be collected through interviews with participants, while the quantitative data will be collected through surveys. 
%Finally, the collected data will be analysed to evaluate households thoughts about the recommendations and energy technologies. 
%The entire process will be documented and reported in the form of a thesis.
