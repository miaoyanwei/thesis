\chapter{Methodology} 

The study uses Design Case Studies \cite{dcs} as the research framework. 


%The methodology adopted in this study is based on the Design Case Studies framework. 
%The pre-study phase will begin by conducting a comprehensive review of the literature to identify best practices for providing households with personalised and professional home energy system recommendations, as well as techno-economic assessments.
%Based on the findings from the pre-study, I will then design the interfaces of the intervention. 
%The interfaces will be developed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience that can easily be understood by households. 
%Following the development phase, real users will be invited to use the intervention, and feedback will be collected both qualitatively and quantitatively. 
%The qualitative data will be collected through interviews with participants, while the quantitative data will be collected through surveys. 
%Finally, the collected data will be analysed to evaluate households thoughts about the recommendations and energy technologies. 
%The entire process will be documented and reported in the form of a thesis.
