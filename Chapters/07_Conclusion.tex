\chapter{Conclusion}

According to Fogg's Persuasive design framework, 
German households exhibit strong "motivations" for adopting energy-efficient technologies. 
The proposed practice of a home energy system recommender works effectively as a "promot," as it provides valuable insights and recommendations to support their decision-making process. 
However, there is a lack of "ability" for many households, 
as they express frustration about the financial challenges of affording a one-time investment to purchase such technologies. 
They are hopeful that policy makers will take action to address this issue and provide support to make energy-efficient technologies more accessible and affordable.
