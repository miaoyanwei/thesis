\chapter{Conclusion}

Our exploration to bridge the gap in knowledge about energy technologies and the associated benefits for homeowners has yielded valuable insights. 

The journey began with an initial phase of pre-study, where our goal was to uncover existing tools and practices that could empower homeowners to embrace sustainable energy solutions. 
This initial investigation paved the way for the development of an innovative home energy system recommender, anchored in the FLEX models. 
These models assist in identifying technology configurations tailored to specific home situations, leading to potential energy cost savings that directly benefit homeowners financially. 
Through this process, homeowners became acquainted with technologies and their associated benefits. 

Throughout the design process, we placed significant emphasis on explainability, ensuring the recommendations were trusted.  
By engaging with real participants through user testing, we have gained a deeper understanding of their expectations, concerns, and attitudes. 
The insights gathered from the feedback lead us to a conclusive observation.


\section{Filling the information gap}

The provision of such information has a significant impact on the decision-making process of homeowners, even though there are slight variations in how different users respond. 
These differences are indicative of varying perspectives of positive attitudes towards investing in such technologies. 
For instance, users who had limited knowledge about energy technologies before using the service expressed that they gained a better understanding of various technologies, their functionalities, and the potential financial benefits.
On the other hand, participants who were already knowledgeable in this field learned about the advantages of different configurations and sizes of technologies tailored to their unique situations.
Moreover, trust remains a pivotal factor within a recommender system, consistently highlighting its critical role in nurturing user confidence and promoting well-informed decisions.

Furthermore, in line with findings from previous studies and surveys, our research also underscores the significance of financial considerations as a primary motivating factor. 
Nevertheless, a notable shift has been observed in our study, where participants express an increasing desire to contribute to environmental protection.
It is noteworthy that this ``green" inclination, while supportive, remains secondary to the financial aspect due to the substantial investment required. 
However, this change in attitude is distinct from the situation observed in a survey conducted in 2013 \cite{informationgap}. 
This evolving perspective suggests a growing awareness and willingness among individuals to embrace more sustainable energy decisions.

In accordance with Fogg's Persuasive Design framework \cite{Fogg2009}, 
where he outlined how technology can effectively influence and change behaviours by considering three key factors: 
\emph{motivation, promot, and ability}. 
Our study reveals that a considerable number of households exhibit strong ``motivations" to embrace energy-efficient technologies. 
The introduced home energy system recommender functions effectively as a ``promot," providing valuable insights and recommendations that facilitate their decision-making processes. 
Although, there is room for improvement in this artefact, as discussed in the previous chapter,
for instance, users with varying levels of knowledge about energy technologies express their specific informational needs.
We envision a promising future for tools like ours.
These tools not only provide valuable information to households, fostering financial benefits and sustainable energy investments, while also potentially aiding in mitigating climate change. 
However, a prevalent ``ability" constraint emerges among many households,
primarily associated with financial challenges that impede one-time investments in these technologies. 
This emphasises the necessity for policy interventions aimed at improving accessibility and affordability. 
We believe that through the provision of accessible information and collaborative efforts from governing bodies, this trend of embracing sustainable energy choices will continue to grow, encouraging more individuals to take meaningful steps toward a greener and more energy-efficient future.  


\section*{Explainability of the recommender}

Explainability has consistently held a prominent role in recommendation system design, as it greatly contributes to fostering trust in the system. 
As discussed in the previous chapter, user feedback has revealed various factors that influence trust and distrust in both recommendations and the system. 
Our recommender system incorporates three levels of explanations, each eliciting responses from users. 

The first level of explanation, which focuses on annual energy bills and provides a comparison with their estimated current bills, garners appreciation from all users. 
This aspect contributes to building trust in the system, as it aligns with their financial concerns as well as enabling a comparison with their real-world situations.
The second level of explanation, which visualises energy consumption patterns, is also well-received by users. 
This visualisation resonates with their understanding of consumption habits and further bolsters their trust.
Additionally, the ability to freely modify configurations and compare results plays a vital role in enhancing trust. 
Witnessing the differences between configurations fosters the belief that the system tailors recommendations to individual situations, rather than offering one-size-fits-all suggestions.
However, the third level of explanation appears to be less appealing to many users, potentially may due to its less user-friendly interaction design, involving extensive text. 
Furthermore, as many users are already familiar with the concept of climate change, this section often serves as a self-checklist rather than a trust-building element.
Consequently, this level of explanation may not significantly contribute to user trust in the recommendations or the system. 
Nevertheless, it serves as valuable supplementary information, allowing users to reflect on their current behaviours and potentially consider more sustainable choices.


\section{Next steps}

Based on the preceding analysis, several key directions emerge for future development:

There is a need to provide access to more comprehensive and detailed information regarding the recommended technologies. 
This could involve incorporating additional explanations, or links to external resources to facilitate a deeper understanding of the technologies.

Considering the positive response to the comparison of energy consumption patterns, adding further information like \gls{co2} emission comparison graph could enhance the users' decision-making process, providing them with another perspective on the environmental impacts of their choices.

Personalisation remains a cornerstone for building trust and user engagement. 
Thus, allowing users to input more personalised data related to their specific context and energy consumption patterns could further enhance the accuracy and relevance of recommendations as well as their confidence in the system.

Additionally, incorporating more detailed insights into the calculation of estimated bills, which may encompass factors such as regional subsidies, would provide users with a more comprehensive understanding of the financial implications associated with their choices.

To broaden the service's utility, the potential integration with the existing ``Energieausweis" requirement is worth exploring. 
Providing an energy certificate as part of the service could serve a purpose of facilitating user understanding and fulfilling a regulatory need.

Expanding the applicability of the service to a broader range of house types should also be considered. 
This can make the service more relevant and accessible to a wider audience. 

The third level of explanation could be more interactive and engaging for users. 
Incorporating visual aids, interactive elements, and concise text to enhance the overall user experience and understanding.

Additionally, to ensure continuous improvement, integrating the Kano survey into the service would be important to allow for ongoing feedback collection. 

Moreover, from a technical perspective, enhancing the flexibility of the service is crucial. 
Current hardcoded elements should be replaced with more dynamic components to ensure adaptability to evolving technologies and changing user requirements. 

By focusing on these next steps, the service can be further refined to provide an even more informative, user-friendly, and effective tool for homeowners making sustainable energy decisions.


\section{Limitations}

This study encompasses certain limitations that need to be considered when interpreting the findings.
\begin{description}
    \item[Small sample size:] The study was conducted with a limited number of participants, which might affect the generalisability of the results.
    \item[Limited knowledge background:] Due to many reasons, approximately half of the participants possessed related knowledge in the energy domain. This could potentially introduce bias into their perceptions and responses.
    \item[Restricted age range:] The age distribution of participants was concentrated around two main age groups: approximately 30 and 60 years old. This might limit the representation of perspectives across a wider age spectrum.
    \item[Age-related technology challenges:] The study revealed that participants aged 65 and above encountered challenges when engaging with the online tool. Older participants indicated a preference for face-to-face consultations and demonstrated a higher level of trust in human experts rather than in an AI system. This could affect the overall user experience and willingness to adopt the recommendations, particularly among older demographics.
    \item[Neglect of rebound effect:] The study does not account for the rebound effect \cite{Herring2007}, which refers to potential changes in household behavior that could result from adopting energy-efficient technologies. This omission could lead to an oversight in estimating the actual impact on energy consumption and subsequent energy bills. While the model assumes a certain comfort lifestyle as a baseline, any significant behavioral shifts induced by the recommended changes might not be accurately captured. Nevertheless, given the reference to comfort lifestyle, it is assumed that the rebound effect's influence would likely be minimal.
\end{description}
These limitations highlight areas for further investigation and potential refinement of the home energy system recommender to accommodate a broader range of users and contexts.
